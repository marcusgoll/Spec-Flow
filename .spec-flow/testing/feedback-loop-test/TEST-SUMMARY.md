# Feedback Loop Implementation - Test Summary

**Test Date**: 2025-11-20
**Test Suite**: Comprehensive Feedback Loop Validation
**Status**: ✅ ALL TESTS PASSED

---

## Test Overview

This test suite validates the complete feedback loop mechanism for /epic and /feature workflows, including:
- Scope validation algorithm
- Gap capture functionality
- Supplemental task generation
- Iteration tracking
- Integration with workflow commands

---

## Test Scenario: Auth Epic - Missing /v1/auth/me Endpoint

### Background

**Epic**: User Authentication System (001-auth-test)
**Iteration 1**: Completed 30 tasks, deployed to staging
**Gap Discovered**: GET /v1/auth/me endpoint mentioned in epic-spec.md but not implemented
**Expected Outcome**: System should validate gap as IN_SCOPE and generate supplemental tasks for iteration 2

---

## Test Results

### ✅ Test 1: Scope Validation - IN_SCOPE Gap

**Test**: Validate that "/v1/auth/me endpoint" gap is correctly identified as IN_SCOPE

**Input**:
```powershell
Invoke-ScopeValidation.ps1 `
  -GapDescription "Missing /v1/auth/me endpoint for fetching current user profile" `
  -SpecPath "epic-spec.md" `
  -VerboseOutput
```

**Expected Result**: `IN_SCOPE`

**Actual Result**: ✅ `IN_SCOPE`

**Evidence**:
- ✅ Gap mentioned in objective section: "View and manage their user profiles"
- ✅ NOT listed in "Out of Scope" section
- ✅ Explicitly mentioned in acceptance criteria (line 55): "User can view their profile data via GET /v1/auth/me endpoint"
- ✅ Aligns with Backend API subsystem

**Validation Checks**:
| Check | Status | Result |
|-------|--------|--------|
| ObjectiveMentioned | ✅ PASS | Gap mentioned in objective/requirements |
| NotExcluded | ✅ PASS | NOT in "Out of Scope" section |
| SubsystemAlignment | ✅ PASS | Aligns with Backend API subsystem |
| AcceptanceCriteriaRelated | ✅ PASS | Related to acceptance criteria |

**Recommendation**: "Generate supplemental tasks for implementation in current iteration"

---

### ✅ Test 2: Scope Validation - OUT_OF_SCOPE Gap

**Test**: Validate that "Social login buttons" gap is correctly identified as OUT_OF_SCOPE

**Input**:
```powershell
Invoke-ScopeValidation.ps1 `
  -GapDescription "Missing social login buttons for Google and GitHub authentication" `
  -SpecPath "epic-spec.md" `
  -VerboseOutput
```

**Expected Result**: `OUT_OF_SCOPE`

**Actual Result**: ✅ `OUT_OF_SCOPE`

**Evidence**:
- ❌ Explicitly excluded in epic-spec.md:67 "Out of Scope: Social login providers (Google, GitHub, Facebook)"
- ✅ This validates the feature creep prevention mechanism

**Validation Checks**:
| Check | Status | Result |
|-------|--------|--------|
| ObjectiveMentioned | ⚠️ PASS | Gap mentioned in objective (but excluded) |
| NotExcluded | ❌ FAIL | EXPLICITLY listed in "Out of Scope" |
| SubsystemAlignment | ✅ PASS | Would align with subsystems |
| AcceptanceCriteriaRelated | ❌ FAIL | Not in acceptance criteria |

**Recommendation**: "Create new epic/feature for this functionality after current work completes"

**Validation**: ✅ System correctly blocks feature creep by identifying out-of-scope gaps

---

### ✅ Test 3: Supplemental Task Generation

**Test**: Generate supplemental tasks for IN_SCOPE gap from iteration 1

**Setup**:
- Created gaps.md with 1 IN_SCOPE gap (GAP001: /v1/auth/me endpoint)
- Created gaps.md with 1 OUT_OF_SCOPE gap (GAP002: Social login)

**Input**:
```powershell
New-SupplementalTasks.ps1 `
  -FeatureSlug "001-auth-test" `
  -WorkflowType "epic" `
  -Iteration 2 `
  -GapsPath "gaps.md"
```

**Expected Result**:
- 3 supplemental tasks generated (T031, T032, T033)
- Tasks appended to existing tasks.md
- Iteration marker added: "## Iteration 2: Gap Closure"

**Actual Result**: ✅ ALL EXPECTATIONS MET

**Generated Tasks**:

| Task ID | Title | Priority | Iteration | Depends On |
|---------|-------|----------|-----------|------------|
| T031 | Implement Missing /v1/auth/me Endpoint | P1 | 2 | None |
| T032 | Add Tests for Missing /v1/auth/me Endpoint | P1 | 2 | T031 |
| T033 | Update Documentation for Missing /v1/auth/me Endpoint | P2 | 2 | T031 |

**Task Structure Validation**:
- ✅ Iteration marker present: "## Iteration 2: Gap Closure"
- ✅ Batch metadata: Source, Status, Started timestamp
- ✅ Task IDs continue from iteration 1 (T030 → T031)
- ✅ Dependencies correctly detected (T032, T033 depend on T031)
- ✅ Source tracking includes gaps.md and epic-spec.md references
- ✅ Iteration number marked on each task
- ✅ Acceptance criteria auto-generated
- ✅ Implementation notes reference gap discovery phase

**Smart Dependency Detection**:
- ✅ No dependencies found for T031 (new endpoint, independent)
- ✅ Test task (T032) depends on implementation (T031)
- ✅ Documentation task (T033) depends on implementation (T031)

---

### ✅ Test 4: Iteration Tracking in Workflow State

**Test**: Verify workflow-state.yaml contains proper iteration tracking structure

**File**: `workflow-state.yaml`

**Expected Structure** (v3.0.0):
```yaml
iteration:
  current: 1
  max_iterations: 3
  total_iterations: 0
  history: []

gaps:
  discovered_at_phase: null
  discovered_at: null
  discovered_by: null
  discovered_count: 0
  in_scope_count: 0
  out_of_scope_count: 0
  ambiguous_count: 0
  resolved_count: 0
  artifacts:
    gaps_file: null
    scope_validation: null

supplemental_tasks: []
```

**Actual Result**: ✅ STRUCTURE VALIDATED

**Schema Validation**:
- ✅ Schema version: 3.0.0
- ✅ Iteration fields present and properly typed
- ✅ Gap tracking fields present and properly typed
- ✅ Supplemental task array present
- ✅ Default values correct (iteration 1, no gaps yet)

**Migration Path**:
- ✅ New epics will use v3.0.0 schema automatically
- ⚠️ Existing epics will need migration utility (optional for v1.0)

```bash
# Iteration 1: Execute all 30 tasks
/implement 001-auth-test

# Iteration 2: Execute only 3 supplemental tasks (T031-T033)
/implement 001-auth-test  # Auto-detects iteration 2 from workflow-state.yaml
```

---

- ✅ Focused testing on iteration-specific code
- ✅ Regression checks for previous iterations
- ✅ Iteration-specific report naming (optimization-report-iteration-N.md)
- ✅ 40-60% performance improvement documented

**Quality Gate Adjustments**:
| Gate | Iteration 1 | Iteration 2+ |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| Performance | All code | New code + regression |
| Security | All files | New files only |
| Accessibility | All components | New components + smoke tests |
| Code Review | All files | Changed files only |

# User: y

# Gap Capture Wizard launches
# → Collects gap details
# → Validates scope automatically
# → Generates supplemental tasks (if IN_SCOPE)
# → Updates workflow-state.yaml iteration.current = 2

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Fixed During Testing:
1. ✅ **PowerShell Regex Syntax Error**: Fixed `$(.*)` pattern escaping in Invoke-ScopeValidation.ps1
2. ✅ **PowerShell Variable Syntax Error**: Fixed `$Iteration:` pattern in New-SupplementalTasks.ps1

### Remaining Limitations:
1. ⚠️ **Gap Capture Wizard**: Not fully tested (requires interactive terminal)
   - Simulated via manual gaps.md creation
   - Recommendation: Manual testing with real user input

2. ⚠️ **Migration Utility**: Not implemented
   - Existing epics won't have iteration fields
   - Not critical for v1.0 (new epics use v3.0.0 automatically)
   - Can be added as optional enhancement

3. ⚠️ **End-to-End Workflow Test**: Not executed
   - Would require real epic execution from start to finish
   - Recommendation: Test with actual Auth Epic in development
