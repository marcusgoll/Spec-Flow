# Pattern structure:
# - id: unique identifier (e.g., "grep-before-read")
#   name: human-readable name
#   description: what this pattern does
#   confidence: 0.0-1.0 (based on occurrences and success rate)
#   occurrences: number of times pattern observed
#   time_saved_avg: average time saved in seconds
#   last_observed: ISO8601 timestamp
#   context: where this applies (e.g., "large files >1000 lines")
#   recommendation: what to do
#   auto_applied: boolean - whether this is auto-applied
#
# Example:
# - id: "grep-before-read-001"
#   name: "Use Grep before Read for large files"
#   description: "Using Grep to search large files before reading saves 2-3 seconds per search"
#   confidence: 0.95
#   occurrences: 12
#   time_saved_avg: 2.5
#   last_observed: "2025-11-21T10:00:00Z"
#   context: "Files >1000 lines in this project"
#   recommendation: "Use Grep with pattern first, then Read only matching files"
#   auto_applied: true
