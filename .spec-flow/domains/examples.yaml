domain: examples
scope: "example-app/, example-workflow-app/"
responsibilities:
  - demonstrate how epic + feature outputs land in product code
  - validate prompts + state flow end-to-end inside demo apps
  - provide reusable components and UI/UX for workflow orchestration
boundaries:
  - no real customer data or secrets
  - keep dependencies limited; heavy integrations belong in epics/
  - example apps should import shared assets from _shared/ when possible
key_assets:
  - example-app/app/*
  - example-workflow-app/app/*
  - example-workflow-app/_shared/*
dry_rules:
  - prefer extending shared UI components before adding new ones
  - align demo prompts with docs/codex guidance
  - reference repo-map roles in README files for each app
