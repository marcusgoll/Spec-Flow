domain: epics
scope: "epics/* + linked specs/*"
responsibilities:
  - capture epic specs, clarifications, plans, tasks, sprint docs
  - maintain epic-level state.yaml with phase + sprint + feature status
  - coordinate subordinate features under specs/<feature>
  - host release notes + ship logs tied to each epic
boundaries:
  - no automation scripts or prompts here
  - feature folders must reference parent epic slug; no orphan specs
  - keep sprint folders under epics/<epic>/sprints/
key_assets:
  - epics/<epic>/spec.md
  - epics/<epic>/plan.md
  - epics/<epic>/tasks.md
  - epics/<epic>/state.yaml
  - epics/<epic>/sprints/<id>/{plan.md,tasks.md,retro.md}
  - specs/<feature>/* linked via state file
dry_rules:
  - reuse templates from .spec-flow/templates/epic-* for new epics
  - keep state.yaml authoritative; feature states only refine
  - link commits + PRs back to epic README or ship log
