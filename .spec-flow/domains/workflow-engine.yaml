domain: workflow-engine
scope: ".spec-flow/*, .claude/hooks*, automation caches"
responsibilities:
  - orchestrate epic + feature commands across phases
  - manage scripts (bash|powershell), templates, memory, repo preferences
  - keep shared learnings + command playbooks in sync
boundaries:
  - no business specs or feature docs
  - commands must respect repo-map boundaries and epic state files
  - avoid duplicating helpers across bash + powershell; share via modules
key_assets:
  - .spec-flow/scripts/bash/*.sh
  - .spec-flow/scripts/powershell/*.ps1
  - .spec-flow/templates/*
  - .spec-flow/memory/*.md
  - .claude/hooks/*
dry_rules:
  - reuse emit/test-emit modules before adding new logging
  - extend existing commands instead of forking new entrypoints
  - document new automation in IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md with tests
