## Detailed Features

<!-- Repeat this section for each discovered feature -->

### [N]. [FEATURE_NAME]

**Screens**: [list of screen files]
**Complexity**: [Epic (multi-subsystem, >16h) | Feature (single subsystem, <16h)]
**Category**: [Foundation | Core | Enhancement | Nice-to-have]

**Why this feature?**
> [Inferred from prototype - what problem does it solve?]

## Recommended Roadmap Import

Based on discovery analysis, recommended import order:

### Phase 1: Foundation (P0)
1. **[Feature]** - Required for all other features

### Phase 2: Core (P0)
2. **[Feature]** - Core value proposition
3. **[Feature]** - Essential user flow

### Phase 3: Enhancement (P1)
4. **[Feature]** - Improves experience
5. **[Feature]** - Adds value

### Phase 4: Nice-to-have (P2)
6. **[Feature]** - Can defer to later

## Suggested Epic Structure

> Based on feature dependencies and complexity, this prototype could become a single epic with the following sprint structure:

### Epic: [EPIC_NAME_SUGGESTION]

**Total Estimated Hours**: [TOTAL_HOURS]h
**Suggested Sprints**: [SPRINT_COUNT]
**Complexity**: [Small (2-3 sprints) | Medium (4-6 sprints) | Large (7+ sprints)]

#### Sprint 1: Foundation (~[HOURS]h)
- [ ] **[Feature A]** - Required by all others (Foundation)
- [ ] **[Feature B]** - Core data layer (Foundation)

#### Sprint 2: Core Value (~[HOURS]h)
- [ ] **[Feature C]** - Main user flow (Core)
- [ ] **[Feature D]** - Depends on A, B (Core)

#### Sprint 3: Polish (~[HOURS]h)
- [ ] **[Feature E]** - Enhancement
- [ ] **[Feature F]** - Nice-to-have

## Feature Dependencies

> Shows which features must be built before others

| Feature | Depends On | Blocks | Sprint |
|---------|------------|--------|--------|
| [Feature A] | - | [Feature C, D] | S1 |
| [Feature B] | - | [Feature C] | S1 |
| [Feature C] | [A, B] | [Feature E] | S2 |
| [Feature D] | [A, B] | - | S2 |
| [Feature E] | [C] | - | S3 |
| [Feature F] | - | - | S3 |

**Critical Path**: [Feature A] → [Feature C] → [Feature E]

## Next Steps

**Option A: One-Shot Epic Creation (Recommended)**
```
/prototype extract --to-epic "Epic Name"
```
Creates epic workspace with pre-populated spec from discoveries.

**Option B: Manual Import**
1. Review this file and adjust feature priorities
2. Resolve open questions (see above)
3. Run `/roadmap import-from-prototype` to create individual roadmap items
4. Start `/epic` or `/feature` for highest priority items

**After either option:**
- Run `/prototype lock-theme` when design decisions are final
