# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository. When addressing the user, sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.

## Overview

The Spec-Flow Workflow Kit orchestrates feature delivery through a series of slash commands that transform product ideas into production releases via Spec-Driven Development. Each command produces auditable artifacts and hands context to the next specialist.

## Core Commands

Run commands in sequence to move features through the workflow:

**Windows (PowerShell 7.3+):**

```powershell
# Validate environment
pwsh -File .spec-flow/scripts/powershell/check-prerequisites.ps1 -Json

# Create new feature
pwsh -File .spec-flow/scripts/powershell/create-new-feature.ps1 "Feature Name"

# Calculate token budget
pwsh -File .spec-flow/scripts/powershell/calculate-tokens.ps1 -FeatureDir specs/NNN-slug

# Compact context when over budget
pwsh -File .spec-flow/scripts/powershell/compact-context.ps1 -FeatureDir specs/NNN-slug -Phase "implementation"
```

**macOS/Linux (Bash 5+):**

```bash
# Validate environment
.spec-flow/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json

# Create new feature
.spec-flow/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh "Feature Name"

# Calculate token budget
.spec-flow/scripts/bash/calculate-tokens.sh --feature-dir specs/NNN-slug

# Compact context when over budget
.spec-flow/scripts/bash/compact-context.sh --feature-dir specs/NNN-slug --phase implementation
```

## Workflow State Machine

Features progress through fixed phases with automatic state tracking:

```
/feature → /clarify (if needed) → /plan → /tasks → /validate → /implement
  ↓
/ship (unified deployment orchestrator)
  ↓
Model-specific workflow:
  • staging-prod: /optimize → /preview → /ship-staging → /validate-staging → /ship-prod
  • direct-prod: /optimize → /preview → /deploy-prod
  • local-only: /optimize → /preview → /build-local
```

**Unified Deployment**:

- Use `/ship` after `/implement` to automatically execute the appropriate deployment workflow
- Deployment model is auto-detected (staging-prod, direct-prod, or local-only)
- Use `/ship continue` to resume after manual gates or failures
- Use `/ship status` to check current progress
- Commands are defined in `.claude/commands/`

**Navigation & Help**:

- Use `/help` anytime to see where you are in the workflow and what to do next
- Shows current phase, completed phases, blockers, and recommended next steps
- Context-aware: different output based on whether you're in a feature, at a manual gate, or blocked
- Run `/help verbose` for detailed state information (quality gates, deployments, artifacts)

## Project Design Workflow

**When to use**: Before building any features, run `/init-project` to create comprehensive project-level design documentation.

**Philosophy**: "Planning is 80% of the project, 20% code." — Project design documentation ensures every feature aligns with system architecture from day one.

### One-Time Project Initialization

```bash
/init-project
```

**Purpose**: Generate 8 comprehensive project documentation files in `docs/project/`

**Interactive Setup** (15 questions, ~10 minutes):
- Project type: greenfield (new) or brownfield (existing codebase)
- Project vision and target users
- Scale tier: micro / small / medium / large
- Team size: solo / small / medium / large
- Tech stack: database, frontend, backend, deployment platform
- Architecture style: monolith / microservices / serverless
- API style: REST / GraphQL / tRPC / gRPC
- Auth provider: Clerk / Auth0 / custom / none
- Deployment model: staging-prod / direct-prod / local-only
- Git workflow: GitHub Flow / Git Flow / Trunk-Based
- Budget constraints and privacy requirements

### Generated Documentation (8 Files)

**Location**: `docs/project/`

1. **overview.md** — Vision, users, scope, success metrics, competitive landscape
2. **system-architecture.md** — C4 diagrams, components, data flows, security architecture
3. **tech-stack.md** — All technology choices with rationale and alternatives rejected
4. **data-architecture.md** — ERD (Mermaid), entity schemas, storage strategy, migrations
5. **api-strategy.md** — REST/GraphQL patterns, auth, versioning, error handling (RFC 7807)
6. **capacity-planning.md** — Scaling from micro (100 users) to 1000x growth with cost model
7. **deployment-strategy.md** — CI/CD pipeline, environments (dev/staging/prod), rollback
8. **development-workflow.md** — Git flow, PR process, testing strategy, Definition of Done

### Brownfield Project Scanning

**If existing codebase detected**, the project-architect agent automatically scans:

**Tech Stack Detection**:
- `package.json` → Node.js, React, Next.js, TypeScript
- `requirements.txt` / `pyproject.toml` → Python, FastAPI, Django
- `Cargo.toml` → Rust
- `go.mod` → Go

**Database Detection**:
- Dependencies: `pg` (PostgreSQL), `mysql2` (MySQL), `mongoose` (MongoDB)
- Migration files: `**/migrations/*.sql`, `**/alembic/versions/*.py`

**Architecture Pattern**:
- `/services/`, `/microservices/` directories → microservices
- Monorepo structure (`/apps/*`, `/packages/*`) → monolith
- `docker-compose.yml` with multiple services → microservices

**Deployment Platform**:
- `vercel.json` → Vercel
- `railway.json` → Railway
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` → GitHub Actions (inspect for platform)
- `Dockerfile` + AWS config → AWS

**Result**: Reduces unknowns by 20-30%, fills docs with accurate existing patterns

### Workflow Integration

**All subsequent commands reference project docs**:

**`/roadmap`**:
- Reads `overview.md` → validates new features against project vision and scope
- Reads `tech-stack.md` → suggests only technically-feasible features (brainstorm)
- Reads `capacity-planning.md` → adjusts effort estimates by scale tier (brainstorm)

**`/spec`**:
- Reads `tech-stack.md` → avoids suggesting wrong technologies
- Reads `api-strategy.md` → follows established REST/GraphQL patterns
- Reads `data-architecture.md` → reuses existing schemas, follows naming conventions
- Reads `system-architecture.md` → identifies integration points

**`/plan`**:
- Reads ALL 8 project docs during Phase 0 (Research)
- Extracts tech stack, architecture constraints, API patterns, data schemas
- Generates `research.md` with project context section
- Ensures plan aligns with capacity tier, deployment model, and cost constraints

**Benefits**:
- **Prevents hallucination** — Tech stack is documented, not guessed
- **Ensures consistency** — All features use same auth, API style, database
- **Avoids duplication** — ERD shows existing entities, preventing redundant tables
- **Speeds up features** — /spec and /plan have full context from day one

### When to Update Project Docs

**Rarely** — Project docs are stable, change infrequently

**Update when**:
- Major tech stack change (e.g., migrating PostgreSQL → MongoDB)
- Architecture evolution (e.g., monolith → microservices)
- New integration (e.g., adding Stripe payments)
- Scale tier increase (e.g., micro → small)

**How to update**: Edit `docs/project/*.md` files directly, then commit

**Anti-pattern**: Don't regenerate with `/init-project` — you'll lose customizations

### Example Output

**Greenfield project** (minimal info):
- Vision, users from questionnaire
- Many `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` sections (user fills later)
- Reasonable defaults (e.g., monolith for solo dev)

**Brownfield project** (rich scan):
- Auto-detected tech stack from `package.json`, `requirements.txt`
- Generated ERD from Alembic migrations
- Detected API patterns from existing routes
- Fewer `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` (more inferred from code)

### Next Steps After `/init-project`

**For Greenfield Projects** (new codebase):
1. **Review** `docs/project/` files
2. **Fill** any `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` sections
3. **Foundation issue auto-created** → GitHub Issue `#1 project-foundation` (HIGH priority)
4. **Build foundation first**: `/feature "project-foundation"`
   - Scaffolds project with documented tech stack (Next.js, Tailwind, PostgreSQL, etc.)
   - Sets up dev environment, linting, deployment config
   - CRITICAL: All other features depend on this
5. **Then add features**: `/roadmap` or `/feature "your-feature"`

**For Brownfield Projects** (existing codebase):
1. **Review** `docs/project/` files
2. **Fill** any `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` sections
3. **No foundation needed** → Existing code detected
4. **Start building features**: `/roadmap` or `/feature "your-feature"`

All features will now align with your documented architecture.

## New Features (v1.1.0)

### YAML State Files

**What Changed**: Workflow state migrated from JSON to YAML.

**Benefits**:

- LLM-friendly (easier for Claude to edit)
- Comments supported
- Human-readable
- Fewer syntax errors

**Prerequisites**:

- **macOS/Linux**: `yq` >= 4.0 (`brew install yq`)
- **Windows**: `yq` >= 4.0 (`choco install yq`)

**Files**: `specs/NNN-slug/workflow-state.yaml` (previously `.json`)

**Auto-Migration**: Automatic conversion from JSON on first access

**Manual Migration**:

```bash
# Bash (with dry-run)
.spec-flow/scripts/bash/migrate-state-to-yaml.sh --dry-run
.spec-flow/scripts/bash/migrate-state-to-yaml.sh

# PowerShell
.spec-flow/scripts/powershell/migrate-state-to-yaml.ps1 -DryRun
.spec-flow/scripts/powershell/migrate-state-to-yaml.ps1
```

### Roadmap Integration (GitHub Issues)

**IMPORTANT**: This workflow is an **npm package**. There are two distinct roadmap use cases:

#### 1. Workflow Development (This Repo)

**Purpose**: Track improvements to the workflow system itself

**Source**: This repo's GitHub Issues

**Status**: ✅ Active (old markdown roadmap archived 2025-10-20)

**Usage**:

```bash
# View workflow improvements
gh issue list --label type:feature

# Create workflow improvement
gh issue create --template feature.yml

# Programmatic creation
source .spec-flow/scripts/bash/github-roadmap-manager.sh
create_roadmap_issue "Improve /roadmap" "Add GitHub Projects" 4 3 0.8 "infra" "all" "roadmap-projects"
```

**See**: `docs/WORKFLOW_DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`

#### 2. User Project Roadmaps (User Repos)

**Purpose**: Product features that users of this workflow are building

**Source**: User's own GitHub Issues (their repos)

**Status**: ⏳ Pending - `/roadmap` command needs update

**Planned Usage** (when implemented):

- Users run `/roadmap` command in their repos
- Creates issues in their GitHub repo (not this one)
- Same ICE scoring and label system
- Integrates with `/feature` and `/ship` commands

**Current Status**: `/roadmap` command uses markdown (legacy, will be updated)

---

**ICE Prioritization**: Issues include YAML frontmatter with Impact/Confidence/Effort scoring

- Score = (Impact × Confidence) / Effort
- Auto-applied priority labels based on score

**Issue Templates**: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`

- `feature.yml` - Features with ICE scoring
- `enhancement.yml` - Enhancements
- `bug.yml` - Bug reports
- `task.yml` - Tasks

**Labels Schema**:

- **Priority**: `priority:high|medium|low` (auto-applied by ICE score)
- **Type**: `type:feature|enhancement|bug|task`
- **Area**: `area:backend|frontend|api|infra|design|marketing`
- **Role**: `role:all|free|student|cfi|school`
- **Status**: `status:backlog|next|later|in-progress|shipped|blocked`
- **Size**: `size:small|medium|large|xl` (auto-applied by effort)

**Core Functions** (for both use cases):

- `.spec-flow/scripts/bash/github-roadmap-manager.sh` - Roadmap functions
- `.spec-flow/scripts/powershell/github-roadmap-manager.ps1` - PowerShell version
- `.spec-flow/scripts/bash/setup-github-labels.sh` - Label setup

**Archived**: `.spec-flow/memory/roadmap-archived-2025-10-20.md` - Old workflow roadmap

**Guides**:

- `docs/WORKFLOW_DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md` - For workflow contributors
- `docs/github-roadmap-migration.md` - Technical reference and user project setup

### Version Management

**Automatic Semantic Versioning**: Every production deployment increments version and creates git tag.

**Process** (during `/ship` Phase S.5):

1. Read current version from `package.json`
2. Analyze spec/ship-report for bump type:
   - "breaking change" → MAJOR (1.2.3 → 2.0.0)
   - "fix"/"bug"/"patch" → PATCH (1.2.3 → 1.2.4)
   - Default → MINOR (1.2.3 → 1.3.0)
3. Update `package.json`
4. Create annotated git tag: `v1.3.0`
5. Generate `RELEASE_NOTES.md`
6. Update roadmap with version

**Scripts**:

- `.spec-flow/scripts/bash/version-manager.sh`
- `.spec-flow/scripts/powershell/version-manager.ps1`

**Manual Bump** (if needed):

```bash
# Bash (interactive)
source .spec-flow/scripts/bash/version-manager.sh
interactive_version_bump "specs/NNN-slug"

# PowerShell (interactive)
. .spec-flow/scripts/powershell/version-manager.ps1
Invoke-InteractiveVersionBump -FeatureDir "specs/NNN-slug"
```

**Non-Blocking**: Continues with warning if `package.json` missing

---

## New Features (v1.2.0) - Workflow Streamlining

### Auto-Continue Workflow

**What Changed**: `/feature` now automatically continues from implementation through deployment.

**Before** (v1.1.0):

```bash
/feature "description"
# ... Phase 4 (implement) completes ...
# ❌ Workflow stops - user must manually run:
/optimize
# ... optimization completes ...
# ❌ Workflow stops again:
/ship
```

**After** (v1.2.0):

```bash
/feature "description"
# ... Phase 4 (implement) completes ...
# ✅ Auto-continues to /optimize
# ... optimization completes ...
# ✅ Auto-continues to /ship
# ... deployment completes ...
# 🎉 Done! (Only stops at manual gates)
```

**Benefits**:

- **30-40% faster** - Eliminates manual transitions between phases
- **Fewer context switches** - Developer doesn't need to babysit workflow
- **Intelligent blocking** - Only stops for critical errors or manual gates

**Manual Gates** (where workflow pauses for human input):

1. **MVP Gate** (during /implement): "Ship P1 MVP now or continue to P2/P3?"
2. **Pre-flight Approval** (before /ship): "Approve deployment start?"
3. **Preview** (after /optimize): Manual UI/UX testing on local dev server
4. **Staging Validation** (after staging deploy): Manual testing in staging environment

**Blocking Conditions** (where workflow stops for fixes):

- ❌ Build failures (frontend/backend/Docker)
- ❌ Critical code review issues (security, contract violations)
- ❌ Deployment failures (CI/CD errors)

**Resume After Stop**:

```bash
/feature continue
# Automatically resumes from last completed phase
```

### Parallel Execution

**What Changed**: Multiple optimization and validation checks now run in parallel for 3-5x speedup.

#### /optimize - 5 Parallel Checks

**Before** (Sequential):

```
Performance → Security → Accessibility → Code Review → Migrations
   ⏱️ 2min     ⏱️ 3min      ⏱️ 2min          ⏱️ 5min         ⏱️ 1min
Total: ~13 minutes
```

**After** (Parallel):

```
Performance ┐
Security    ├─→ All run simultaneously
Accessibility │
Code Review   │
Migrations    ┘
Total: ~5 minutes (4-5x faster)
```

**Implementation**:

- All 5 checks launched as parallel Task() calls in single message
- Results aggregated after all complete
- Critical issues block deployment
- Auto-fix option for fixable issues

#### /ship Pre-flight - 5 Parallel Checks

**Before** (Sequential):

```
Env Vars → Build → Docker → CI Config → Dependencies
  ⏱️ 1min    ⏱️ 3min  ⏱️ 4min    ⏱️ 1min      ⏱️ 2min
Total: ~11 minutes
```

**After** (Parallel):

```
Env Vars   ┐
Build      ├─→ All run simultaneously
Docker     │
CI Config  │
Dependencies┘
Total: ~4 minutes (3-4x faster)
```

**Implementation**:

- All 5 checks launched as background bash jobs (&)
- Results aggregated using wait command
- Build failures block deployment
- Detailed logs per check in preflight-logs/

#### /design-variations - N Parallel Screens

**What Changed**: Design variants for multiple screens generated in parallel.

**Before** (Sequential):

```
Screen 1 → Screen 2 → Screen 3 → Screen 4 → Screen 5
  ⏱️ 5min     ⏱️ 5min     ⏱️ 5min     ⏱️ 5min     ⏱️ 5min
Total: 25 minutes
```

**After** (Parallel):

```
Screen 1 ┐
Screen 2 ├─→ All screens generated simultaneously
Screen 3 │
Screen 4 │
Screen 5 ┘
Total: ~5 minutes (5x faster for 5 screens)
```

**Implementation**:

- Each screen gets dedicated frontend-shipper agent
- All agents launched in single message with multiple Task() calls
- Nx speedup where N = number of screens

### Performance Summary

**Overall Workflow** (feature start → production):

- **Before**: Manual phase transitions + sequential checks = slower
- **After**: Auto-continue + parallel execution = 30-40% faster overall

**Specific Improvements**:

- `/optimize` phase: **4-5x faster** (13min → 5min)
- `/ship` pre-flight: **3-4x faster** (11min → 4min)
- `/design-variations`: **Nx faster** (25min → 5min for 5 screens)
- Phase transitions: **Instant** (no manual delays)

### Workflow State Management

**Enhanced State Tracking** (workflow-state.yaml):

- Tracks current phase and completion status
- Records quality gate results (pre-flight, code review, rollback)
- Stores manual gate approvals (preview, staging validation)
- Enables resume capability with `/feature continue`

**State Example**:

```yaml
workflow:
  phase: ship:optimize
  status: in_progress
  completed_phases:
    - spec
    - plan
    - tasks
    - validate
    - implement
  manual_gates:
    preview:
      status: pending
      timestamp: 2025-10-21T10:30:00Z
quality_gates:
  pre_flight:
    passed: true
    checks:
      env: passed
      build: passed
      docker: passed
      ci: passed
      deps: warning
```

### Breaking Changes

None - all changes are backward compatible. Existing workflows continue to work, but won't get auto-continue or parallel execution benefits until updated.

### Migration

No migration required - changes are in command definitions, not state files.

## New Features (v2.3.0) - Implement Phase Sub Agent

### Sub Agent Architecture

**What Changed**: Phase 4 (Implementation) now uses a dedicated sub agent with intelligent task batching.

**Before** (v2.2.0):

```bash
/feature "description"
# ... Phase 4 starts ...
# Main instance directly calls /implement
# Sequential task execution
# Context grows throughout implementation
```

**After** (v2.3.0):

```bash
/feature "description"
# ... Phase 4 starts ...
# Main instance launches implement-phase-agent (Task() call)
# Sub agent analyzes task dependencies
# Groups tasks into parallel batches
# Executes batches with parallel Task() calls
# Returns summary to main instance
```

**Benefits**:

- **Fresh context** - Implement phase gets isolated context (solves context loss)
- **2x faster** - Parallel task batching (30min → 15min for 20 tasks)
- **Better error isolation** - Errors contained in sub agent context
- **Improved reliability** - Clear phase boundaries prevent premature transitions

### Intelligent Task Batching

**Dependency Analysis**:
The implement-phase-agent analyzes tasks to identify parallel execution opportunities:

```
Example: User Authentication Feature (15 tasks)

Batch 1 (Independent - 3 tasks in parallel):
  ├─ T001: Database schema
  ├─ T002: API routes setup
  └─ T003: Frontend components setup

Batch 2 (Depends on Batch 1 - 5 tasks in parallel):
  ├─ T005: User model (needs T001)
  ├─ T006: Session model (needs T001)
  ├─ T007: Auth endpoints (needs T002)
  ├─ T008: Login component (needs T003)
  └─ T009: Register component (needs T003)

Batch 3 (Depends on Batch 2 - 4 tasks in parallel):
  ├─ T010: Integration tests
  ├─ T011: E2E login tests
  ├─ T012: E2E register tests
  └─ T013: API security tests

Batch 4 (Final - 3 tasks in parallel):
  ├─ T014: Performance tests
  ├─ T015: Documentation
  └─ T016: Error handling refinement
```

**Execution**:

- Each batch runs tasks in parallel using multiple Task() calls
- Batches execute sequentially (Batch 2 waits for Batch 1)
- Progress tracked after each batch
- Commits created per batch

**Performance**:

```
Sequential (v2.2.0): 15 tasks × 4 min avg = ~60 minutes
Parallel (v2.3.0): 4 batches × ~8 min avg = ~32 minutes
Speedup: 1.9x (approaching 2x)
```

### Batching Strategy

**Optimal Batch Size**: 2-5 tasks per batch

- Too small (1 task): No parallelization benefit
- Too large (10+ tasks): Higher failure risk, harder debugging

**Parallelization Rules**:

- ✅ **DO parallel**: Different domains (DB + API + Frontend)
- ✅ **DO parallel**: Same domain, different entities (User model + Post model)
- ❌ **DON'T parallel**: Sequential dependencies (Schema → Model → API)
- ❌ **DON'T parallel**: Shared resources (same file modifications)

**Batch Ordering**:

1. **Setup/Infrastructure** - Database, routes, components
2. **Core Logic** - Models, endpoints, UI logic
3. **Integration** - Tests, connecting pieces
4. **Final** - Documentation, cleanup

### Context Management

**Token Budget** (implement-phase-agent):

```
Reading context files:        ~10,000 tokens
  ├─ tasks.md
  ├─ NOTES.md
  ├─ plan.md (first 100 lines)
  └─ workflow-state.yaml

Dependency analysis:           ~5,000 tokens
Batch 1-4 execution:          ~80,000 tokens
  ├─ 4 batches
  ├─ 3-5 tasks per batch avg
  └─ ~15-20k per task agent

Progress checking:             ~3,000 tokens
Summary generation:            ~2,000 tokens

Total: ~100,000 tokens (within 150k limit)
```

**Fresh Context Per Phase**:

- Main instance: Lightweight orchestration (~30k tokens)
- Implement sub agent: Isolated context (~100k tokens)
- Task sub agents: Individual contexts (~15-20k each)

Total workflow token reduction: 240k → 80k (67% savings maintained from v1.0)

### Error Handling

**Batch-Level Recovery**:

```bash
# If Batch 2 fails:
❌ Batch 2 incomplete: T006 failed (dependency issue)

Blockers:
  - T006: Auth endpoint - Missing session model import
  - Error log: specs/001-auth/error-log.md

Options:
  1. Fix T006 manually
  2. Run: /feature continue (resumes from Batch 2)
```

**Clear Error Propagation**:

- Sub agent logs errors to error-log.md
- Returns structured failure JSON to main instance
- Main instance displays blockers and resume instructions
- User fixes issues and resumes with `/feature continue`

### Agent Brief Location

- **Command**: `.claude/commands/feature.md` (Phase 4 section)
- **Agent Brief**: `.claude/agents/phase/implement.md`

**Agent Capabilities**:

- Dependency analysis algorithm
- Batch execution strategy
- Parallel Task() launching
- Progress tracking per batch
- Structured summary generation

### Migration from v2.2.0

**Automatic** - No user action required:

- Existing workflows use new sub agent automatically
- Phase 4 behavior changes from direct /implement to Task() call
- Task batching happens transparently
- Resume capability preserved

**Performance Gains**:

- Existing features: 2x faster implementation
- New features: Immediate benefit
- Mixed dependency tasks: Optimal batch grouping

### Breaking Changes

None - all changes are backward compatible. The implement-phase-agent reads the same task formats (TDD-phase and user-story) as before.

---

## New Features (v2.4.0) - Roadmap & Foundation Improvements

### Roadmap Technical Validation

**What Changed**: `/roadmap brainstorm` now reads project documentation to ensure technically-grounded feature suggestions.

**Before** (v2.3.0):
```bash
/roadmap brainstorm
# Only reads: constitution.md
# May suggest: GraphQL features (but project uses REST)
# May suggest: Real-time features (but project is micro-tier)
# Effort estimates: Generic (doesn't account for scale)
```

**After** (v2.4.0):
```bash
/roadmap brainstorm
# Reads: constitution.md + tech-stack.md + capacity-planning.md
# Only suggests: Features compatible with REST API
# Flags new tech: [NEW TECH: GraphQL] if suggested
# Effort estimates: Adjusted by scale tier (micro=1-2, large=5-8)
```

**Project Docs Read**:
- `tech-stack.md` → Available technologies, deployment platform, auth provider
- `capacity-planning.md` → Scale tier (micro/small/medium/large), cost constraints

**Benefits**:
- Prevents suggesting infeasible features (GraphQL when using REST)
- Prevents over-scoping (real-time for micro-tier projects)
- More accurate effort estimates (accounts for scale complexity)
- Reduces wasted roadmap planning (features rejected later by `/spec`)

**Applies to**: Both quick and deep brainstorm tiers

---

### Greenfield Foundation Auto-Creation

**What Changed**: `/init-project` now automatically creates a "Project Foundation Setup" GitHub Issue for greenfield projects.

**Before** (v2.3.0):
```bash
/init-project
# Generates 8 docs
# Commits to git
# Stops → User must manually run /feature "Foundation"
```

**After** (v2.4.0):
```bash
/init-project
# Generates 8 docs
# Commits to git
# Auto-creates GitHub Issue: #1 project-foundation
#   - Priority: HIGH (Score: 1.5)
#   - Pre-populated with tech stack requirements
#   - Includes acceptance criteria (dev server runs, build succeeds)
# Next steps: /feature "project-foundation"
```

**Issue Details**:
- **Title**: "Project Foundation Setup"
- **Slug**: `project-foundation`
- **ICE Score**: Impact=5, Effort=3, Confidence=0.9 → Score=1.5 (HIGH priority)
- **Labels**: `type:feature`, `area:infra`, `role:all`, `status:backlog`, `size:medium`
- **Body Includes**:
  - Frontend setup (Next.js, Tailwind, TypeScript, etc.)
  - Backend setup (FastAPI, PostgreSQL, etc.)
  - Infrastructure (deployment, auth, CI/CD)
  - Dev environment (.env, Docker, git hooks)
  - Acceptance criteria (8 checkboxes)
  - References to all 4 relevant project docs

**Brownfield Projects**: Skips foundation issue creation (existing code detected)

**Graceful Fallback**: If GitHub auth fails, prints instructions to create manually

**Benefits**:
- Eliminates manual step (no need to remember foundation feature)
- Pre-populated spec (all tech stack details from `/init-project`)
- Clear priority (HIGH - blocks all other features)
- Discoverable (`gh issue view project-foundation`)

---

### Updated Documentation

**Workflow Integration** section now reflects `/roadmap` reads 3 docs:
1. `overview.md` → Vision alignment
2. `tech-stack.md` → Technical feasibility (NEW)
3. `capacity-planning.md` → Effort estimation by scale tier (NEW)

**Next Steps After `/init-project`** section now distinguishes:
- **Greenfield**: Foundation issue created → Build foundation first → Add features
- **Brownfield**: No foundation needed → Start building features immediately

---

### Migration from v2.3.0

**Automatic** - No user action required:
- Existing `/roadmap brainstorm` will read tech docs automatically (if they exist)
- New `/init-project` runs will create foundation issues automatically
- Old projects unaffected (no retroactive foundation issues)

**Breaking Changes**: None - all changes are backward compatible

---

## New Features (v2.5.0) - Constitution Cleanup & Structure Simplification

### Constitution Split into 3 Files

**What Changed**: Monolithic `constitution.md` (609 lines) split into 3 focused files for clarity.

**Before** (v2.4.0):

**After** (v2.5.0):
```
docs/project/                              (User's project files)
├── engineering-principles.md  (189 lines - 8 core principles)
└── project-configuration.md   (62 lines - deployment model, scale tier)

.spec-flow/memory/                         (Workflow system files)
└── workflow-mechanics.md      (356 lines - roadmap, versioning, gates)
```

**Why Split**:
- **Clarity**: User files vs workflow files clearly separated
- **Maintainability**: Each file <400 lines (was 609 lines)
- **Ownership**: Users edit `docs/project/`, workflow team edits `.spec-flow/`
- **Modularity**: Commands read only what they need

---

### Updated Commands

**1. `/setup-constitution` → `/update-project-config`**
- **Renamed** for clarity (was confusing)
- **Simplified** from 862 lines → 207 lines (76% reduction!)
- **Fixed** broken reference (was targeting non-existent file)
- **Now updates**: `docs/project/project-configuration.md` (deployment model, scale tier)

**2. `/constitution`**
- **Rewritten** to update engineering principles
- **Now updates**: `docs/project/engineering-principles.md` (8 core standards)
- **Simplified** to 165 lines (was duplicate of /setup-constitution)

**3. `/init-project`**
- **Now generates 10 docs** instead of 8:
  - Added: `engineering-principles.md`
  - Added: `project-configuration.md`
- **Templates created**: `.spec-flow/templates/engineering-principles.md`, `.spec-flow/templates/project-configuration.md`

---

### Removed Stale Roadmap References

**Problem**: `/spec` and `/ship-prod` still referenced deleted `roadmap.md` (migrated to GitHub Issues on 2025-10-20)

**Fixed**:
- **`/spec`**: Now uses `gh issue list` instead of searching `roadmap.md`
- **`/ship-prod`**: Now uses `mark_issue_shipped()` function from `github-roadmap-manager.sh`
- **Path constants**: Updated to reference new files (`engineering-principles.md`, `workflow-mechanics.md`)

---

### New 10-Document Structure

**After `/init-project`, users get:**

```
docs/project/
├── overview.md                    (Vision, users, scope)
├── system-architecture.md         (C4 diagrams, components)
├── tech-stack.md                  (Technology choices)
├── data-architecture.md           (ERD, schemas)
├── api-strategy.md                (REST/GraphQL patterns)
├── capacity-planning.md           (Scaling tiers)
├── deployment-strategy.md         (CI/CD pipeline)
├── development-workflow.md        (Git flow, PR process)
├── engineering-principles.md      (NEW - 8 core principles)
└── project-configuration.md       (NEW - deployment model, scale)
```

**Workflow system files** (users don't edit):

```
.spec-flow/memory/
├── workflow-mechanics.md          (NEW - roadmap, versioning, gates)
├── design-principles.md           (S-tier design guide)
├── design-inspirations.md         (Reference template)
└── archive/
    ├── constitution-legacy-2025-11-04.md
    └── roadmap-archived-2025-10-20.md
```

---

### Benefits

**Clarity**:
- ✅ User files (`docs/project/`) vs workflow files (`.spec-flow/memory/`) clearly separated
- ✅ No more confusion about which file to edit

**Correctness**:
- ✅ Fixed `/setup-constitution` targeting non-existent file
- ✅ Fixed stale `roadmap.md` references in `/spec` and `/ship-prod`

**Simplicity**:
- ✅ Smaller, focused files (<400 lines each vs 609 lines)
- ✅ Commands simplified (862 → 207 lines for `/update-project-config`)
- ✅ Clear ownership (users vs workflow team)

**Consistency**:
- ✅ Aligns with existing `/init-project` pattern (`docs/project/`)
- ✅ Engineering principles guide quality gates (`/optimize`, `/validate`)

---

### Migration from v2.4.0

**Automatic** - No user action required:
- Old `constitution.md` archived to `.spec-flow/memory/archive/`
- Commands automatically use new file paths
- Existing projects continue to work

**For New Projects**:
- `/init-project` generates 10 docs (was 8)
- Use `/constitution` to update engineering principles
- Use `/update-project-config` to change deployment model

**Breaking Changes**: None - all changes are backward compatible

---

## Architecture

**Directory structure:**

- `.claude/agents/` — Persona briefs for specialists (backend, frontend, QA, release)
- `.claude/commands/` — Command specifications with inputs, outputs, and auto-progression
- `.spec-flow/memory/` — Workflow mechanics, design principles, inspirations (workflow system files)
- `.spec-flow/templates/` — Markdown scaffolds for specs, plans, tasks, reports
- `.spec-flow/scripts/powershell/` — Windows/cross-platform automation
- `.spec-flow/scripts/bash/` — macOS/Linux automation
- `specs/NNN-slug/` — Feature working directories created by `/feature`

**Context management:**

- Phase-based token budgets: Planning (75k), Implementation (100k), Optimization (125k)
- Auto-compact at 80% threshold using phase-aware strategies
- Compaction reduces context by 90%/60%/30% depending on phase
- Run `calculate-tokens` before heavy operations to check budget

## Key Artifacts

Each command produces structured outputs:

| Command             | Artifacts                                                         |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/feature`          | `spec.md`, `NOTES.md`, `visuals/README.md`, `workflow-state.yaml` |
| `/plan`             | `plan.md`, `research.md`                                          |
| `/tasks`            | `tasks.md` (20-30 tasks with acceptance criteria)                 |
| `/validate`         | `analysis-report.md`                                              |
| `/implement`        | Implementation checklist + task completion                        |
| `/ship`             | `ship-summary.md`, state updates, deployment orchestration        |
| `/optimize`         | `optimization-report.md`, `code-review-report.md`                 |
| `/preview`          | `release-notes.md`, preview checklist                             |
| `/ship-staging`     | `staging-ship-report.md`, `deployment-metadata.json`              |
| `/validate-staging` | Staging sign-off summary, rollback test results                   |
| `/ship-prod`        | `production-ship-report.md`, release version                      |
| `/deploy-prod`      | `production-ship-report.md`, deployment IDs                       |
| `/build-local`      | `local-build-report.md`, build artifacts analysis                 |
| `/deploy-status`    | Real-time deployment status display                               |

**State Management**: All commands update `workflow-state.yaml` with:

- Current phase and status
- Completed/failed phases
- Quality gates (pre-flight, code review, rollback capability)
- Manual gates (preview, staging validation)
- Deployment information (URLs, IDs, timestamps)
- Artifact paths

## Deployment Models

The workflow automatically detects and adapts to three deployment models:

### staging-prod (Recommended)

- **Detection**: Git remote + staging branch + `.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml`
- **Workflow**: optimize → preview → ship-staging → validate-staging → ship-prod
- **Features**: Full staging validation, rollback testing, production promotion
- **Use for**: Production applications, team projects, critical deployments

### direct-prod

- **Detection**: Git remote + no staging branch/workflow
- **Workflow**: optimize → preview → deploy-prod
- **Features**: Direct production deployment, deployment ID tracking
- **Use for**: Simple applications, solo developers, rapid iteration
- **Risk**: Higher (no staging validation)

### local-only

- **Detection**: No git remote configured
- **Workflow**: optimize → preview → build-local
- **Features**: Local build validation, security scanning, artifact analysis
- **Use for**: Local development, prototypes, desktop applications

**Override**: Set deployment model explicitly in `.spec-flow/memory/constitution.md`

## Quality Gates

### Pre-flight Validation (Blocking)

- Environment variables configured
- Production build succeeds
- Docker images build
- CI configuration valid
- Dependencies checked

**Blocks deployment if failed**

### Code Review Gate (Blocking)

- No critical code quality issues
- Performance benchmarks met
- Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Security scan completed

**Blocks deployment if critical issues found**

### Rollback Capability Gate (staging-prod only, Blocking)

- Deployment IDs extracted from logs
- Rollback test executed (actual Vercel alias change)
- Previous deployment verified live
- Roll-forward verified

**Blocks production if rollback test fails**

### Manual Gates (Pause for approval)

- **Preview**: Manual UI/UX testing on local dev server
- **Staging Validation**: Manual testing in staging environment (staging-prod only)

**Requires `/ship continue` to proceed**

## Coding Standards

**Markdown:**

- Sentence-case headings
- Wrap near 100 characters
- Imperative voice for instructions
- Bullets for checklists

**PowerShell scripts:**

- Four-space indentation
- `Verb-Noun` function names
- Comment-based help
- No aliases in scripts
- Support `-WhatIf` where feasible

**Shell scripts:**

- POSIX-friendly
- Exit on error (`set -e`)
- Document required tools in header

**Naming:**

- Use `kebab-case` for all files (e.g., `agent-brief.md`)
- CamelCase only for PowerShell modules

## Commit Convention

Follow Conventional Commits:

- `feat:` new feature
- `fix:` bug fix
- `docs:` documentation
- `chore:` maintenance
- `refactor:` code restructure
- `test:` test additions

Example: `docs: refresh debugger brief`

Keep subjects under 75 characters, imperative mood.

## Testing

No CI pipeline yet. Validate locally before submitting:

- PowerShell: `Invoke-Pester -Path tests`
- Shell: Test with `-WhatIf` flags or dry-run modes
- Markdown: Preview in renderer, verify token estimates with `calculate-tokens`

## Agent Briefs

Specialist agents are organized in `.claude/agents/` by category:

**Phase Orchestrators** (`phase/`):

- `spec.md`, `clarify.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `validate.md`, `implement.md`, `optimize.md`, `ship-staging.md`, `ship-prod.md`, `finalize.md`

**Implementation Specialists** (`implementation/`):

- `backend.md` — Backend implementation
- `frontend.md` — Frontend implementation
- `database.md` — Database architecture
- `api-contracts.md` — API contract management

**Quality Specialists** (`quality/`):

- `code-reviewer.md` — Code review
- `qa-tester.md` — QA and testing
- `test-coverage.md` — Test coverage enhancement
- `debug.md` — Error triage and debugging

**Deployment Specialists** (`deployment/`):

- `release.md` — CI/CD and release management

When working with agents, load the relevant brief for context on capabilities and responsibilities.

## Philosophy

1. **Specification first** — Every artifact traces to explicit requirements
2. **Agents as teammates** — Commands encode expectations for alignment
3. **Context discipline** — Token budgets measured, compacted, recycled
4. **Ship in stages** — Staging and production have dedicated rituals with human gates
