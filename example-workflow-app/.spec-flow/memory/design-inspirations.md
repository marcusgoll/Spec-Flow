## Usage Guidelines

**When to add entries:**
- Found inspiring design during research
- User or team member shares good example
- Discovered pattern that solves a real user problem we face

**What to capture:**
- Quick observations (not exhaustive analysis)
- Specific elements (button styles, animations, layout patterns)
- Why it matters for our audience

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't duplicate feature-specific visuals/README.md (use that for deep dives)
- Don't add every site you see (quality > quantity)
- Don't capture patterns that conflict with our principles (simplicity, clarity, accessibility)
