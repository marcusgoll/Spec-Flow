## Web Applications

### Full-Stack Web App (React + Node.js)

**Example**: Building a SaaS dashboard with authentication, data visualization, and CRUD operations.

**Workflow Adaptations**:

1. **Specification Phase** (`/spec-flow`):
   - Define user flows (login, dashboard, settings)
   -\spec-flow API contracts between frontend and backend
   - Document data models and relationships
   - Include responsive design requirements (mobile, tablet, desktop)

2. **Planning Phase** (`/plan`):
   - Architecture: Frontend (React), Backend (Express), Database (PostgreSQL)
   - API endpoint design (RESTful or GraphQL)
   - State management strategy (Redux, Context, Zustand)
   - Authentication approach (JWT, sessions, OAuth)

3. **Task Breakdown** (`/tasks`):
   - Separate frontend and backend tasks
   - Example:
     - T001-T010: Backend API endpoints
     - T011-T020: Frontend components
     - T021-T025: Integration tests
     - T026-T028: E2E tests

4. **Implementation** (`/implement`):
   - Route backend tasks to `backend-dev` agent
   - Route frontend tasks to `frontend-shipper` agent
   - Parallel development of API and UI

**Agent Configuration**:
```markdown
# .claude/agents/project-backend-dev.md
Specializes in:

## Team Structures

### Solo Developer

**Workflow**: Use `/flow` for full automation with manual gates at preview and staging.

**Customizations**:
- Skip code review phase (or self-review)
- Simplify agent briefs (one agent does all work)
- Faster iteration cycles

**Example**:
```bash
/flow "Dark mode toggle"
# Automated: spec → plan → tasks → implement → optimize
# Manual gate: preview (test locally)
# Automated: ship to staging
# Manual gate: validate staging
# Automated: ship to production
```

---

### Small Team (2-5 developers)

**Workflow**: Spec-first collaboration, one person writes spec, team reviews, then parallel implementation.

**Process**:
1. **Product lead** writes spec (`/spec-flow`)
2. **Team reviews** spec asynchronously (GitHub PR)
3. **Lead generates plan** (`/plan`) and tasks (`/tasks`)
4. **Developers pick tasks** from tasks.md
5. **Parallel implementation**, track progress in NOTES.md
6. **Code review** before merging

**Customizations**:
- Add CODEOWNERS for automatic review assignment
- Use GitHub Projects for task tracking
- Daily standup reviews NOTES.md checkpoints

---

### Large Team (6+ developers, multiple squads)

**Workflow**: Squad-based features, dedicated spec writers, specialized agents.

**Structure**:
- **Product squad**: Writes specs and manages roadmap
- **Backend squad**: Implements backend features
- **Frontend squad**: Implements frontend features
- **QA squad**: Validates and tests

**Process**:
1. **Product squad** creates multiple specs in parallel
2. **Specs reviewed** by all squads (feasibility, effort)
3. **Backend and frontend squads** work in parallel on same feature
4. **Integration testing** by QA squad
5. **Coordinated deployment** to staging and production

**Customizations**:
- Multiple agent briefs per squad
- Separate repos for backend/frontend with shared spec repo
- Advanced CI/CD with deployment pipelines
- Feature flags for gradual rollout

## Choosing the Right Approach

### Decision Matrix

| Project Type | Spec Complexity | Agent Specialization | Timeline | Testing Focus |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------------|----------|---------------|
| **Web App** | High (frontend + backend) | High (2+ agents) | 2-4 weeks | E2E, integration |
| **API** | Medium (contracts) | Medium (backend only) | 1-3 weeks | Contract, load |
| **CLI** | Low (commands) | Low (single agent) | 1-2 weeks | Unit, integration |
| **Mobile** | High (offline, native) | High (2+ agents) | 3-6 weeks | E2E, device |
| **Design System** | Medium (components) | Medium (frontend) | 2-4 weeks | Visual, a11y |
| **Infrastructure** | Medium (IaC) | Low (single agent) | 1-2 weeks | Security, cost |
| **Docs** | Low (content) | Low (single agent) | 1 week | Link checking |
| **ML** | High (data + model) | High (2+ agents) | 4-8 weeks | Evaluation |

## Customization Tips

### Adapting Templates

1. **Copy and customize templates**:
   ```bash
   cp .spec-flow/templates/spec-template.md .spec-flow/templates/cli-spec-template.md
   # Edit to add CLI-specific sections
   ```

2. **Update command definitions** to use custom templates:
   ```markdown
   # .claude/commands/spec-flow.md
   Use template: .spec-flow/templates/cli-spec-template.md
   ```

### Custom Agent Briefs

Create project-specific agents:

```bash
# Backend specialist for your stack
cp .claude/agents/backend-dev.md .claude/agents/project-api-dev.md

# Edit to\spec-flow:
# - Your stack (FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis)
# - Your patterns (repository pattern, service layer)
# - Your testing tools (pytest, pytest-asyncio)
```

### Constitution Alignment

Tailor principles to your domain:

```markdown
# .spec-flow/memory/constitution.md

## Domain-Specific Principles

### Aviation Compliance (for flight school app)
- All features MUST comply with FAA Part 61/141 regulations
- Student records MUST be retained for 3 years minimum
- Instructor signatures MUST be verified electronically

### Healthcare Compliance (for medical app)
- All features MUST be HIPAA compliant
- PHI MUST be encrypted at rest and in transit
- Audit logs MUST be immutable and retained for 7 years
```

2. **Review the example feature** in `specs/001-example-feature/`
3. **Customize templates** for your project type
4. **Set up agents** for your tech stack
5. **Define your constitution** with domain-specific principles
