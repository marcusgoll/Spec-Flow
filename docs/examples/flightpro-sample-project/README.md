## Generated Files

This example includes **2 complete files** (overview.md and tech-stack.md) to demonstrate what filled-in project documentation looks like:

1. ✅ **overview.md** — Vision, users, scope, success metrics
2. ✅ **tech-stack.md** — Technology choices with rationale
3. ⏭️ system-architecture.md (see template in `.spec-flow/templates/project/`)
4. ⏭️ data-architecture.md (see template)
5. ⏭️ api-strategy.md (see template)
6. ⏭️ capacity-planning.md (see template)
7. ⏭️ deployment-strategy.md (see template)
8. ⏭️ development-workflow.md (see template)

**Why only 2 files?**: To keep the example concise while showing real-world content. Refer to templates in `.spec-flow/templates/project/` for the other 6 documents.

---

## How to Use This Example

### 1. Review the Files

Read `overview.md` and `tech-stack.md` to see:
- How to fill in `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` sections
- What realistic examples look like
- How to structure content

### 2. Compare to Templates

Compare these files to the templates in `.spec-flow/templates/project/`:
- What changed? (placeholders → real content)
- What was removed? (`[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers filled in)
- What was added? (realistic examples, Mermaid diagrams)

### 3. Use as Reference

When you run `/init-project` for your own project:
- Use this example to understand expectations
- See how to document tech stack rationale
- Learn how to write vision statements and user personas

## Key Differences from Template

### Template (before /init-project):
```markdown
## Vision Statement

[One paragraph: What is this project, why does it exist, what problem does it solve?]

**Example**: FlightPro is a SaaS platform...
```

### Example (after /init-project):
```markdown
## Vision Statement

FlightPro is a SaaS platform that helps certified flight instructors (CFIs)
manage their students, track progress, and maintain compliance with FAA
regulations. We exist because current solutions are either too expensive
($200+/mo) or lack critical features like ACS-mapped progress tracking.
```

**Notice**: Placeholder replaced with actual content based on user answers.

## Next Steps

1. Run `/init-project` in your own project
2. Compare your output to this example
3. Fill `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` sections (if any)
4. Commit to git
5. Start building features with `/roadmap` or `/feature`
