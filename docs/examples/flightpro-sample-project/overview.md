# Project Overview

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-24
**Status**: Active (MVP in development)

---

## Vision Statement

FlightPro is a SaaS platform that helps certified flight instructors (CFIs) manage their students, track progress, and maintain compliance with FAA regulations. We exist because current solutions are either too expensive ($200+/mo for small flight schools) or lack critical features like ACS-mapped progress tracking and automated FAA record-keeping.

**Core problem solved**: CFIs spend 5-10 hours/week on administrative work (spreadsheets, paper logbooks, manual progress tracking). FlightPro automates this down to <1 hour/week, letting instructors focus on teaching.

## Target Users

### Primary Persona: Independent CFI

**Who**: Independent certified flight instructor (CFI)
- 25-55 years old
- Teaches 5-20 students concurrently
- Works at small flight schools or independently
- Tech-savvy but not developers
- Budget-conscious ($50-100/mo acceptable)

**Goals**:
- Track student progress toward certificates (Private, Instrument, Commercial)
- Log lessons with FAA-compliant records
- Identify weak areas requiring additional practice
- Automate administrative work (reports, student records)
- Stay organized across multiple students

**Pain Points**:
- **Current tools too expensive**: ForeFlight Logbook ($99/year/student), MyFlightBook ($free but no CFI features), CloudAhoy ($200/year)
- **No ACS mapping**: Hard to track which Airman Certification Standards (ACS) tasks are complete
- **Manual progress reports**: Copy-paste student progress into emails/PDFs weekly
- **Paper logbooks**: Students forget them, lose them, or fill them incorrectly
- **No reminders**: Forget to check medical certificate expirations, written test dates

**Success scenario**: "I open FlightPro, see my schedule for the day, check that Student A needs more work on short-field landings (ACS task flagged), log today's lesson in 2 minutes, and auto-generate a progress report for the student's parents ‚Äî all in <5 minutes."

---

### Secondary Persona: Student Pilot

**Who**: Aviation student working toward certificate
- 18-65 years old
- Training for Private Pilot, Instrument, or Commercial certificate
- Flies 1-4 times/month (cost-dependent)
- Wants to track own progress

**Goals**:
- View progress toward certificate completion
- See weak areas requiring practice
- Access lesson history and notes
- Track total flight hours
- Receive reminders (medical renewal, written test expiration)

**Pain Points**:
- **No visibility**: CFI has all records, student doesn't know where they stand
- **Manual tracking**: Keep separate spreadsheet of hours by type (dual, PIC, night, XC)
- **Lost logbooks**: Paper logbooks lost/damaged = lost records
- **Unclear progress**: "How many more lessons until checkride?" is guesswork

**Success scenario**: "I log into FlightPro, see I'm 85% complete toward my Private Pilot certificate, see that I need 3 more hours of night flying, and book my next lesson with my CFI ‚Äî all in one place."

## Core Value Proposition

**For** independent CFIs and student pilots
**Who** need efficient student management and progress tracking
**The** FlightPro
**Is a** web application
**That** automates administrative work and tracks ACS-aligned progress
**Unlike** ForeFlight Logbook, MyFlightBook, CloudAhoy
**Our product** costs <$50/mo, has ACS-mapped progress tracking, and auto-generates FAA-compliant reports

**Key differentiators**:
1. **ACS-Mapped Progress** ‚Äî Industry-first visual tracking of Airman Certification Standards tasks
2. **Affordable** ‚Äî $10/mo per CFI (10x cheaper than competitors)
3. **Auto Reports** ‚Äî Generate student progress reports in 1 click (competitors require manual copy-paste)
4. **Dual Access** ‚Äî Both CFI and student see progress (competitors are CFI-only or student-only)

## Success Metrics

### North Star Metric
**Active CFIs logging lessons weekly**

**Target**: 100 CFIs within 6 months of launch

**Why this metric**: Revenue follows engagement. If CFIs log lessons, they pay. If they don't, they churn.

## Scope Boundaries

### In Scope (What we're building)

**MVP (Phase 1 ‚Äî First 3 months)**:
- ‚úÖ User authentication (CFI + student roles)
- ‚úÖ Student management (add/edit/archive students)
- ‚úÖ Lesson logging (date, hours, aircraft, notes)
- ‚úÖ Basic progress tracking (total hours, lessons completed)
- ‚úÖ ACS task checklist (Private Pilot only)
- ‚úÖ Student dashboard (view own progress)

**Post-MVP (Phase 2 ‚Äî Months 4-6)**:
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Automated progress reports (PDF generation)
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Reminders (medical expiration, written test expiration)
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Multi-certificate support (Instrument, Commercial)
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Billing & subscriptions (Stripe integration)

**Future (Phase 3 ‚Äî Months 7+)**:
- üí° Flight school management (multi-CFI view, aircraft scheduling)
- üí° Mobile app (iOS/Android for in-flight logging)
- üí° Integrations (ForeFlight, Garmin Pilot, CloudAhoy import)

---

### Out of Scope (What we're NOT building)

**Explicitly excluded**:
- ‚ùå **Flight planning** (use ForeFlight, Garmin Pilot ‚Äî we integrate, don't replace)
- ‚ùå **Aircraft maintenance tracking** (different market, different buyer)
- ‚ùå **Flight school ERP** (scheduling, billing, payroll ‚Äî too complex for MVP)
- ‚ùå **Logbook for Part 121/135 pilots** (airline/charter market has different needs)
- ‚ùå **FAA written test prep** (Sporty's, King Schools own this market)

**Rationale**: Focus on CFI administrative work automation. Don't compete with established products (ForeFlight for planning, Sporty's for test prep). Integrate, don't duplicate.

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- **Budget**: $50/mo for MVP hosting (Vercel Hobby + Railway Starter)
- **Team**: Solo developer (20 hrs/week)
- **Timeline**: 3 months to MVP (60 hrs/month √ó 3 = 180 hours total)

### Business Constraints
- **Pricing**: Must be <$50/mo to compete with free tools (target $10/mo)
- **Compliance**: Must maintain FAA-compliant records (backup, audit trail)
- **Privacy**: Student data is PII (FERPA-adjacent, not HIPAA)

### Assumptions (Risks if wrong)
- **Assumption 1**: CFIs will pay $10/mo for time savings
  - **Risk**: If not, revenue = 0
  - **Mitigation**: Beta test pricing with 5 CFIs before launch
- **Assumption 2**: ACS-mapped progress is valuable differentiation
  - **Risk**: If CFIs don't care, no competitive advantage
  - **Mitigation**: Validate with user interviews (5+ CFIs)
- **Assumption 3**: Students want to see their own progress
  - **Risk**: If CFIs prefer to control all data, dual access is wasted effort
  - **Mitigation**: Test student view with 10 students during beta
