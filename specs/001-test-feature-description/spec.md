## Quality Gates *(all must pass before `/plan`)*

### Core Requirements
- [ ] No implementation details (tech stack, APIs, code)
- [ ] Requirements testable and unambiguous
- [ ] Context strategy documented
- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - **FAILED: 30+ clarifications needed**

## Summary

This specification was created from a minimal feature description ("test feature description") that lacks sufficient detail to produce a complete specification. The spec has been marked with 30+ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers throughout all major sections.

**Required clarifications**:
1. What is the purpose of this feature?
2. Who are the target users?
3. What problem does it solve?
4. What are the key user actions?
5. Does it have UI components?
6. What are the success criteria?
7. What are the technical constraints?

**Next step**: Run `/clarify` to resolve ambiguities before proceeding to `/plan`.
