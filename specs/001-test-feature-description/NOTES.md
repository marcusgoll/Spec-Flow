# Feature: Test Feature Description

## Overview

This feature specification was generated from a minimal input: "test feature description". Due to the extremely generic nature of this description, the specification has been populated with clarification markers throughout all major sections.

**Generated**: 2025-10-08
**Branch**: 001-test-feature-description
**Status**: Requires Clarification

## Feature Classification

Based on the generic input, classification could not be determined:
- UI screens: Unknown (requires clarification)
- Improvement: Unknown (requires clarification)
- Measurable: Unknown (requires clarification)
- Deployment impact: Unknown (requires clarification)

**Decision**: All artifacts generated with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers due to insufficient input.

## Research Findings

### Constitution Check
- Status: Not performed (cannot assess alignment without feature details)
- Source: .spec-flow/memory/constitution.md

### UI Inventory Check
- Status: Not performed (cannot determine if UI components needed)
- Source: design/systems/ui-inventory.md

### Similar Features
- Status: Not searched (no keywords available from generic description)
- Source: Glob specs/**/spec.md

### External Research
- Status: Not performed (no specific pattern to research)

## System Components Analysis

**Status**: Deferred pending clarification

Cannot analyze component requirements without understanding:
1. Whether feature has UI components
2. What functionality is needed
3. What user interactions are involved

## Key Decisions

1. **Generate minimal spec with clarification markers**: Given the generic input, created a specification template that highlights all areas requiring clarification rather than making assumptions.

2. **Skip detailed research**: Did not perform extensive research phase since there are no specific keywords, patterns, or requirements to research.

3. **Flag quality gate failures**: Explicitly documented that quality gates have not been met and /clarify is required before proceeding.

## Blockers

1. Feature description is too generic to derive meaningful requirements
2. Cannot define user scenarios without understanding user needs
3. Cannot define success metrics without understanding feature goals
4. Cannot assess deployment impact without technical scope
5. Cannot determine if UI components are needed

## Clarification Questions

The following areas require clarification before proceeding:

### Feature Purpose
- What problem does this feature solve?
- Who are the target users?
- What is the business goal?

### User Experience
- What actions should users be able to perform?
- What is the primary user journey?
- Are there UI components involved?

### Success Criteria
- How will success be measured?
- What metrics matter?
- What is the expected improvement?

### Technical Scope
- Does this require new infrastructure?
- Are there API changes?
- Are there database changes?
- What platforms are affected (Vercel, Railway)?

### Dependencies
- Are there upstream/downstream system dependencies?
- Are there third-party integrations?
- Are there environment variable changes needed?

## Checkpoints

- Phase 0 (Spec-flow): 2025-10-08 - Generated minimal spec with 30+ clarification markers
- Next Phase: /clarify (required)

## Deployment Metadata
