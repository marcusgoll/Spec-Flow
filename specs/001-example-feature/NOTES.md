## Decisions

### Why CSS variables instead of CSS-in-JS?
Better performance (no runtime overhead), easier debugging in DevTools, simpler implementation. CSS-in-JS would add bundle size and complexity for minimal benefit.

### Why support 'system' option?
Modern UX expectation. Users expect apps to respect their OS-level preference. Implementing this from the start avoids migration pain later.

### Why 300ms transition?
Research shows 200-400ms is optimal for perceived smoothness without feeling sluggish. Tested at 150ms (too fast, jarring), 500ms (too slow), 300ms was the sweet spot.

## Blockers Resolved

### Blocker 1: localStorage not available in Safari Private Mode
**Resolution**: Implemented try-catch wrapper with fallback to sessionStorage, then in-memory state. Degradation is graceful.

### Blocker 2: FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content) on initial load
**Resolution**: Added inline script in index.html to set theme class before React hydration. Eliminates flicker.

## Research Notes

### Design System Audit
Reviewed 15 popular design systems (Material UI, Chakra, Ant Design). Common patterns:
- CSS custom properties for theming
- Context provider for theme state
- Toggle button in navigation
- Smooth transitions (200-400ms)

### Accessibility Considerations
- WCAG 2.1 AA requires 4.5:1 contrast for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- Both themes must meet contrast requirements
- Toggle button needs aria-label and keyboard support
- Avoid relying solely on color to convey information

## Lessons Learned

1. **Start with accessibility** - Adding it later is harder. Built WCAG compliance from the start.
2. **Test system preference early** - prefers-color-scheme detection varies by browser. Caught Safari quirks early.
3. **Performance matters** - Users notice sluggish theme switches. 200ms target was critical.
4. **Fallbacks are essential** - localStorage, system preference, JavaScript - all need fallbacks.
