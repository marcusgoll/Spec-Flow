# Feature Specification: Dark Mode Toggle

**Branch**: `001-dark-mode-toggle`
**Created**: 2025-10-03
**Status**: Example (Complete)

## User Scenarios

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to toggle between light and dark themes in the application so that I can reduce eye strain when working in low-light environments.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am on any page of the application, **When** I click the theme toggle button, **Then** the entire UI switches to dark mode and my preference is saved
2. **Given** I have dark mode enabled, **When** I refresh the page, **Then** dark mode persists across sessions
3. **Given** I am a new user with no saved preference, **When** I first visit the app, **Then** the theme matches my system preference (prefers-color-scheme)

### Edge Cases
- What happens when JavaScript is disabled? (Fallback to system preference)
- How does the system handle rapid toggle clicks? (Debounce to prevent flickering)
- What if localStorage is unavailable? (Graceful degradation to session-only)

## Visual References

See `./visuals/README.md` for UI research and design patterns

## Context Strategy & Signal Design

- **System prompt altitude**: Component-level implementation with accessibility guidelines
- **Tool surface**: React hooks, CSS variables, localStorage API
- **Examples in scope**: 3 canonical examples (button, provider, persistence)
- **Context budget**: 15k tokens target + compaction at 12k
- **Retrieval strategy**: JIT for design system colors and component patterns
- **Memory artifacts**: NOTES.md updated per task completion; TODO.md for blockers
- **Compaction cadence**: Summaries every 5 completed tasks
- **Sub-agents**: Frontend agent for React implementation, QA agent for accessibility testing

## Requirements

### Functional (testable only)

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a visible toggle button accessible from the navigation bar
- **FR-002**: Users MUST be able to switch between light and dark themes with a single click
- **FR-003**: System MUST persist theme preference in localStorage with key "theme-preference"
- **FR-004**: System MUST apply theme changes to all UI components within 200ms
- **FR-005**: System MUST respect system preference (prefers-color-scheme) for first-time visitors
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide smooth transition animation between themes (300ms fade)

### Non-Functional

- **NFR-001**: Performance: Theme switch must complete within 200ms (P95)
- **NFR-002**: Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for both themes (contrast ratio ≥4.5:1 for normal text)
- **NFR-003**: Mobile: Toggle button must be accessible on all screen sizes (≥320px width)
- **NFR-004**: Browser Support: Must work in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (last 2 versions)

## Technical Design

### Architecture
- **ThemeProvider** context wrapping the application root
- **useTheme** hook for components to access/modify theme
- CSS variables for color tokens (--color-background, --color-text, etc.)
- localStorage API for persistence

### Data Model
```typescript
type Theme = 'light' | 'dark' | 'system'
interface ThemeState {
  theme: Theme
  effectiveTheme: 'light' | 'dark' // resolved theme after system detection
  setTheme: (theme: Theme) => void
}
```

### Files to Modify
- `src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx` (create)
- `src/components/ThemeToggle.tsx` (create)
- `src/styles/tokens.css` (create variables)
- `src/App.tsx` (wrap with ThemeProvider)

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- ThemeProvider provides correct context values
- useTheme hook returns expected theme state
- localStorage persistence works correctly
- System preference detection works

### Integration Tests
- Theme toggle updates all components
- Preference persists across page refreshes
- Smooth transitions occur without flicker

### E2E Tests
- User can toggle theme from navigation
- Theme persists after browser restart
- System preference is respected on first visit

## Success Metrics
- Toggle button has ≥95% click-through rate for users spending >5 min in app
- Theme preference persistence works for ≥99% of users
- No accessibility violations in dark mode
- Performance budget met: <200ms theme switch

## Out of Scope (for this iteration)
- Custom theme colors (user-defined palettes)
- High-contrast mode
- Automatic theme switching based on time of day
- Per-page theme overrides
