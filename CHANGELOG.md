## [4.4.1] - 2025-11-11

### Fixed
- **Package contents**: Updated package.json files array to use directory glob patterns (.claude/commands/**)
- **Removed duplicates**: Deleted 13 duplicate root-level command files (now in subdirectories)
- **Proper exclusion**: Ensured internal/ command directory is excluded from npm package
- **Issue**: v4.4.0 used old flat file listing, missing reorganized commands in subdirectories

**Impact**: Users installing v4.4.1 now receive all 46 reorganized commands correctly. v4.4.0 users should upgrade.

---

## [4.4.0] - 2025-11-11

### Changed
- Version bump to 4.4.0

<!-- Add detailed release notes here -->

---

## [4.3.1] - 2025-11-10

### 🐛 Bug Fix - Package Fix

**Fixed npm package missing new commands**

- **Critical Fix**: Added 13 missing command files to package.json "files" array
- Commands now properly included in npm package:
  - `/contract.bump`, `/contract.verify`, `/fixture.refresh`
  - `/branch.enforce`
  - `/flag.add`, `/flag.list`, `/flag.cleanup`
  - `/gate.ci`, `/gate.sec`
  - `/metrics-dora`
  - `/scheduler.assign`, `/scheduler.park`, `/scheduler.list`

**Problem**: v4.3.0 shipped without the 13 new epic/sprint commands due to explicit package.json whitelist not being updated.

**Impact**: Users installing v4.3.1 now receive all 13 new commands. v4.3.0 users should upgrade immediately.
