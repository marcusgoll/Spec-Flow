## [2.2.0] - 2025-10-21

### Added - Workflow Streamlining & Parallel Execution

**Major Performance Improvements**: End-to-end workflow is now 30-40% faster with intelligent auto-continue and parallel execution.

#### Auto-Continue Workflow
- `/feature` now automatically continues from implementation → optimization → deployment
- Eliminates manual phase transitions (previously required `/optimize` then `/ship`)
- Stops only at manual gates (MVP, pre-flight, preview, staging validation)
- Blocks automatically on critical errors (builds, code review, deployments)
- Resume with `/feature continue` after any stop

#### Parallel Execution
- **`/optimize`**: 5 checks run in parallel (4-5x faster: 13min → 5min)
  - Performance benchmarks, Security scans, Accessibility audits, Code review, Migration validation
- **`/ship` pre-flight**: 5 validation checks in parallel (3-4x faster: 11min → 4min)
  - Environment variables, Build validation, Docker images, CI config, Dependencies
- **`/design-variations`**: Multiple screens generated in parallel (Nx speedup)
  - Example: 5 screens = 25min → 5min (5x faster)

#### Enhanced State Management
- Better completion signaling from `/implement` phase
- Enhanced workflow state tracking for auto-continue
- Detailed logs for parallel execution results

### Changed
- `/feature.md`: Added auto-continue logic for phases 4→5→6
- `/implement.md`: Enhanced completion signaling with workflow state updates
- `/optimize.md`: Refactored to parallel Task() calls for all checks
- `/ship.md`: Refactored pre-flight to parallel background jobs
- `/design-variations.md`: Added parallel screen generation guidance
- `CLAUDE.md`: Comprehensive v1.2.0 documentation with performance metrics

### Performance Metrics
- Overall workflow: **30-40% faster** end-to-end
- `/optimize` phase: **4-5x speedup** (13min → 5min)
- `/ship` pre-flight: **3-4x speedup** (11min → 4min)
- Design variations: **Nx speedup** (linear with screen count)
- Phase transitions: **Instant** (no manual delays)

---

## [2.1.4] - 2025-10-21

### Changed
- Version bump to 2.1.4

<!-- User should add release notes here -->

---

## [2.1.3] - 2025-10-21

### Fixed - GitHub Issues Roadmap Integration

**Rationale**: Features were not being marked as "Shipped" in GitHub Issues roadmap after deployment.

#### Problem

After migrating to GitHub Issues in v2.1.0, the `/roadmap` command correctly used the new `github-roadmap-manager.sh` functions, but other workflow commands (`/ship`, `/feature`) were still sourcing the old markdown-based `roadmap-manager.sh` and calling outdated function names.

#### Root Cause

**Workflow commands had stale references**:
- `/ship.md`: Called `mark_feature_shipped()` (old markdown function)
- `/feature.md`: Called `mark_feature_in_progress()` (old markdown function)
- Both sourced `roadmap-manager.sh` instead of `github-roadmap-manager.sh`

**Result**: Features started and shipped successfully, but GitHub Issues roadmap never updated.

#### Changes

**Files Updated**:
- `.claude/commands/ship.md`
  - Source: `roadmap-manager.sh` → `github-roadmap-manager.sh`
  - Function: `mark_feature_shipped()` → `mark_issue_shipped()`
- `.claude/commands/feature.md`
  - Source: `roadmap-manager.sh` → `github-roadmap-manager.sh`
  - Function: `mark_feature_in_progress()` → `mark_issue_in_progress()`
- `.claude/commands/implement.md`
  - Updated comments to reference new GitHub Issues functions

#### Impact

**Roadmap now correctly updates when features are**:

1. **Started** (`/feature "description"` or `/feature next`):
   - GitHub Issue: `status:next` → `status:in-progress`
   - Message: `✅ Marked issue #N as In Progress in roadmap`

2. **Shipped** (`/ship` Phase S.5):
   - GitHub Issue: → `status:shipped`
   - Issue closed with reason: "completed"
   - Comment added: "🚀 Shipped in v{version}" with date and production URL
   - Message: `✅ Marked issue #N as Shipped (vX.Y.Z) in roadmap`

**User-Visible Changes**:
- ✅ Roadmap automatically syncs with feature workflow
- ✅ Issues close when features ship to production
- ✅ Version history tracked in issue comments
- ✅ Full traceability from roadmap → implementation → deployment

**Breaking Changes**: None

---

## [2.1.2] - 2025-10-21

### Added - /feature next Auto-Pull from Roadmap

**Rationale**: Streamline feature workflow initiation by automatically pulling the highest priority roadmap item.

#### New Feature: `/feature next` Command

The `/feature` command now supports automatic roadmap item selection:

**Usage**:
```bash
/feature next
```

**Functionality**:
- Queries GitHub Issues for highest priority feature
- Searches `status:next` first, falls back to `status:backlog`
- Sorts by priority labels (`priority:high` → `priority:medium` → `priority:low`)
- Extracts slug from YAML frontmatter (or generates from title)
- Displays feature details with ICE score
- Auto-updates issue status from `next`/`backlog` → `in-progress`
- Links workflow state to GitHub issue for tracking

**Example Output**:
```
🔍 Searching for highest priority roadmap item...

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📋 Next Feature Selected
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Issue: #42
Title: Dark mode toggle for settings
Slug: dark-mode-toggle

Priority: high (ICE Score: 8.00)
  Impact: 8 | Confidence: 10 | Effort: 10

📌 Updating issue status to in-progress...
✅ Issue #42 marked as in-progress

Starting feature workflow...
```

**Implementation Details**:
- Added PARSE ARGUMENTS support for "next" mode
- New FETCH NEXT FEATURE section with GitHub Issues query
- Slug extraction from issue frontmatter
- Auto-status update using GitHub CLI
- GitHub issue number stored in `workflow-state.yaml`

**Benefits**:
✅ No manual feature description needed
✅ Always works on highest priority item
✅ Automatic roadmap sync (issue status updated)
✅ Full traceability (workflow linked to issue)
✅ Reduces context switching

**Breaking Changes**: None

---

## [2.1.1] - 2025-10-21

### Changed - Documentation Cleanup

**Rationale**: Complete removal of deprecated `/flow` command references for consistency and clarity.

#### Background

The `/flow` command was:
- Deprecated in v1.14.0 as an alias
- Officially removed in v2.0.0 and replaced by `/feature`
- `/feature` uses isolated phase contexts (67% token reduction, 2-3x faster)

However, documentation and example files still contained legacy `/flow` references that needed cleanup.

#### Changes

**Documentation Updated** (13 references):
- `QUICKSTART.md` - 4 occurrences → `/feature`
- `docs/use-cases.md` - 2 occurrences → `/feature`
- `docs/troubleshooting.md` - 2 occurrences → `/feature`
- `docs/getting-started.md` - 2 occurrences → `/feature`
- `docs/architecture.md` - 3 occurrences → `/feature`

**Command Files Updated** (19 references):
- `.claude/commands/clarify.md` - Workflow progression
- `.claude/commands/plan.md` - Automation reference
- `.claude/commands/quick.md` - Comparison table and guidelines
- `.claude/commands/spec.md` - Workflow automation
- `.claude/commands/ship-staging.md` - Deployment instructions

**Configuration Updated**:
- `.spec-flow/memory/constitution.md` - Quick change guidelines

**Example App Cleanup**:
- Deleted: `example-workflow-app/.claude/commands/flow.md` (614 lines, outdated orchestrator)
- Updated: `example-workflow-app/CLAUDE.md` - Workflow references

**Impact**:
✅ All documentation consistently references `/feature`
✅ Example app shows current best practices
✅ No confusion about which orchestrator to use
✅ Clean codebase (652 lines removed)

**Breaking Changes**: None - command was already removed in v2.0.0

---

## [2.1.0] - 2025-10-21

### Changed - /roadmap Command GitHub Issues Backend

**Rationale**: Complete migration from markdown files to GitHub Issues for native integration, better collaboration, and automated workflows.

#### Complete /roadmap Rewrite

The `/roadmap` command now uses GitHub Issues instead of `.spec-flow/memory/roadmap.md`:

**Backend Migration**:
- Replaced all markdown file operations with GitHub API calls
- Uses `github-roadmap-manager.sh/ps1` functions for CRUD operations
- Label-based state management (`status:backlog`, `status:next`, `status:in-progress`, `status:shipped`)
- ICE scoring preserved in YAML frontmatter in issue descriptions
- Priority labels auto-applied based on ICE score thresholds

**Actions Updated**:
- **INITIALIZE**: Now checks GitHub authentication (gh CLI or API token)
- **ADD FEATURE**: Creates GitHub issue with `create_roadmap_issue()`
- **BRAINSTORM**: Fetches existing features from GitHub Issues via `gh issue list`
- **MOVE FEATURE**: Updates status labels instead of moving between markdown sections
- **DELETE FEATURE**: Closes issue with `wont-fix` label
- **SHIP FEATURE**: Calls `mark_issue_shipped()` to close issue and add shipped label
- **SEARCH**: Uses GitHub Issues search API

**Auto-Sort Logic**:
- Dynamic sorting via priority labels (`priority:high`, `priority:medium`, `priority:low`)
- No manual file editing needed (queries handle sorting automatically)
- GitHub Projects can provide visual roadmap with drag-and-drop

**Template Removal**:
- Deleted `.spec-flow/templates/roadmap-template.md` (no longer needed)

#### Breaking Changes

**Migration Required**:
- Old markdown roadmap data must be migrated to GitHub Issues
- Use `.spec-flow/scripts/bash/migrate-roadmap-to-github.sh` for automated migration
- Manual setup: Run `.spec-flow/scripts/bash/setup-github-labels.sh` to create labels

**Authentication Required**:
- Must authenticate with GitHub via `gh auth login` OR set `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable
- Commands will fail if no GitHub authentication is available

#### Preserved Functionality

All existing workflows still work:
- ICE scoring (Impact × Confidence / Effort)
- Auto-split for large features (>30 requirements or effort >4)
- Brainstorm (quick and deep tiers)
- Clarifications workflow (manual, recommend, skip)
- Same user-facing actions and mental model

**Benefits**:
✅ **Native integration**: Issues, PRs, and roadmap in one place
✅ **Better collaboration**: Comments, subscriptions, mentions on issues
✅ **Automatic linking**: PRs automatically close issues when merged
✅ **Rich metadata**: Labels, milestones, assignees, projects
✅ **API access**: Programmatic roadmap management
✅ **No sync complexity**: Single source of truth in GitHub
✅ **Dynamic sorting**: Query-based prioritization, no file edits

**Documentation**: See `docs/github-roadmap-migration.md` for complete setup guide.

## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-20

### Added - TodoWrite Tool Integration

**Rationale**: Provide real-time progress visibility for long-running commands (15-40 minute workflows with 20-30 tasks).

#### Progress Tracking in 5 Key Commands

Commands now include comprehensive TodoWrite tool integration:

1. **`/implement`** (TASK TRACKING)
   - Tracks 20-30 tasks during parallel execution
   - One todo per task from tasks.md
   - Clear visibility during 15-30 minute implementation phase

2. **`/optimize`** (PROGRESS TRACKING)
   - Tracks 8 validation phases (performance, security, a11y, code review)
   - Real-time updates during 10-20 minute optimization

3. **`/fix-ci`** (BLOCKER TRACKING)
   - Dynamic todo list adapted to actual blockers found
   - Tracks lint/types/tests/build fixes separately
   - Shows which fixes are in progress vs completed

4. **`/ship`** (DEPLOYMENT TRACKING)
   - Tracks 5-8 deployment phases (varies by model: staging-prod, direct-prod, local-only)
   - Includes manual gates (preview, staging validation)
   - Progress visibility during 20-40 minute deployments

5. **`/feature`** (WORKFLOW TRACKING)
   - Tracks 8-14 phases (full feature orchestration)
   - Adapts to project type and feature characteristics
   - Clear progress during 1-3 hour end-to-end workflows with manual gates

#### TodoWrite Integration Pattern

Each command now includes:
- Example JavaScript with typical todo structure
- Guidance on adapting todos dynamically based on context
- Instructions: mark `in_progress` when starting, `completed` immediately after finishing
- Best practice: "Only ONE task should be `in_progress` at a time"
- "Why" section explaining user benefit

**Benefits**:
✅ **Real-time visibility**: Users see which tasks are in progress during long operations
✅ **Better UX**: Clear progress indication instead of waiting blindly
✅ **Debugging**: Easy to see where workflow failed if issues occur
✅ **Multi-phase workflows**: Essential for commands with 20+ tasks or manual gates

---

Five new templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`:
1. `feature.yml` - Feature requests
2. `enhancement.yml` - Enhancements to existing features
3. `bug.yml` - Bug reports
4. `task.yml` - General tasks
5. `config.yml` - Template configuration

#### Roadmap Archive

- Old `roadmap.md` archived to `roadmap-archived-2025-10-20.md`
- Archive README with migration guide
- Preservation of historical roadmap data

**Benefits**:
✅ **Better collaboration**: Use GitHub's native issue tracking
✅ **Automation**: Auto-close issues on PR merge, auto-label
✅ **Visibility**: Public roadmap visible to all contributors
✅ **Integration**: Works with GitHub Projects, milestones, and automation

---

### Added - NPM Package CLI Tool

**Rationale**: Provide interactive CLI for roadmap setup and migration to improve user onboarding.

5. `NPM_PACKAGE_ROADMAP_SUMMARY.md` - NPM package roadmap summary

**Benefits**:
✅ **Easy onboarding**: Interactive setup vs manual configuration
✅ **Better UX**: Clear prompts and validation
✅ **Automation**: One command to set up entire roadmap system
✅ **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for users

---

### Changed - Command Cleanup & Internal Command Marking (BREAKING CHANGES)

**Rationale**: Simplify command structure, remove deprecated aliases, and clearly distinguish internal commands from user-facing ones.

#### Removed Commands (BREAKING)

Three deprecated command aliases have been removed. These were marked for deprecation in v1.16.0:

- **`/dry-run`** → Use `/test-deploy` instead
- **`/preflight`** → Use `/validate-deploy` instead
- **`/ship-status`** → Use `/deploy-status` instead

**Migration**: Replace old command names with new ones in your workflows:
```bash
# OLD (no longer works)
/dry-run
/preflight
/ship-status

# NEW (use these instead)
/test-deploy
/validate-deploy
/deploy-status
```

#### Deprecated Commands (Removal in v2.1.0)

- **`/test-deploy`** → Use `/validate-deploy` instead
  - Reason: `/validate-deploy` provides more comprehensive checks (env vars, migrations, types, bundle sizes, Lighthouse)
  - `/test-deploy` only validates config files and Docker builds (subset of `/validate-deploy`)

#### Internal Commands Marked

Five commands are now clearly marked as **internal** (called automatically by other commands):

1. **`/route-agent`** - Called by `/implement` (task routing)
2. **`/ship-staging`** - Called by `/ship` (staging deployment)
3. **`/ship-prod`** - Called by `/ship` (production deployment)
4. **`/deploy-prod`** - Called by `/ship` when model is `direct-prod`
5. **`/build-local`** - Called by `/ship` when model is `local-only`

Each now includes:
- `internal: true` in frontmatter metadata
- Warning header: "⚠️ INTERNAL COMMAND: Use `/ship` instead"

**User Impact**: Most users only need `/ship` - internal commands are auto-invoked. Advanced users can still call them directly if needed.

#### Benefits

✅ **Cleaner command list**: Removed 3 deprecated aliases
✅ **Clear separation**: Internal vs user-facing commands
✅ **Better UX**: Users know which commands to use
✅ **Reduced confusion**: No duplicate commands with different names

### Files Modified

- 3 deprecated command files deleted (`dry-run.md`, `preflight.md`, `ship-status.md`)
- 1 command deprecated (`test-deploy.md` - removal in v2.1.0)
- 5 commands marked internal (`route-agent.md`, `ship-staging.md`, `ship-prod.md`, `deploy-prod.md`, `build-local.md`)
- package.json bumped to v2.0.0

**Migration Path**:
- Update any scripts/documentation using old command names
- If you were calling internal commands directly, consider using `/ship` instead (or continue using internal commands if you need fine-grained control)

**Impact**: BREAKING for users still using `/dry-run`, `/preflight`, or `/ship-status`. All other users unaffected.

---

## [1.16.0] - 2025-01-19

### Changed - Agent Organization & Command Clarity

**Agent Reorganization**: Restructured 19 agents into 4 category-based folders for better discoverability.

#### New Agent Structure
```
.claude/agents/
├── phase/              # Phase orchestrators (10 agents)
│   ├── spec.md, clarify.md, plan.md, tasks.md, validate.md
│   ├── implement.md, optimize.md, ship-staging.md, ship-prod.md, finalize.md
├── implementation/     # Code specialists (4 agents)
│   ├── backend.md, frontend.md, database.md, api-contracts.md
├── quality/           # Testing & review (4 agents)
│   ├── code-reviewer.md, qa-tester.md, test-coverage.md, debug.md
└── deployment/        # CI/CD (1 agent)
    └── release.md
```

**Agent Renames** (for consistency):
- `spec-phase-agent.md` → `phase/spec.md`
- `analyze-phase-agent.md` → `phase/validate.md` (aligns with v1.14.0 command rename)
- `backend-dev.md` → `implementation/backend.md`
- `frontend-shipper.md` → `implementation/frontend.md`
- `database-architect.md` → `implementation/database.md`
- `contracts-sdk.md` → `implementation/api-contracts.md`
- `senior-code-reviewer.md` → `quality/code-reviewer.md`
- `qa-test.md` → `quality/qa-tester.md`
- `coverage-enhancer.md` → `quality/test-coverage.md`
- `debugger.md` → `quality/debug.md`
- `ci-cd-release.md` → `deployment/release.md`
- (All phase agents lost `-phase-agent` suffix)

**Command Renames** (with deprecation path):
- `/constitution` → `/setup-constitution` (clearer that it's a setup command)
- `/preflight` → `/validate-deploy` (self-documents validation purpose)
- `/dry-run` → `/test-deploy` (clearer that it tests without deploying)
- `/ship-status` → `/deploy-status` (matches other deploy-* commands)

**Removed Deprecated Commands** (cleanup from v1.14.0):
- `/analyze`, `/checks`, `/measure-heart`, `/phase-1-ship`, `/phase-2-ship`, `/spec-flow`, `/specify`

**Updated References**:
- `.claude/commands/feature.md` - Updated all `subagent_type` references to new paths
- `.claude/commands/implement.md` - Updated worker agent references
- `CLAUDE.md` - New agent briefs section with categories
- `README.md` - Updated command examples

#### Benefits
✅ **Better discoverability**: Agents organized by purpose (phase/implementation/quality/deployment)
✅ **Consistent naming**: Removed inconsistent suffixes (-agent, -dev, -shipper, -architect)
✅ **Clearer commands**: Self-documenting names (setup-constitution, validate-deploy, test-deploy)
✅ **Simpler structure**: Easy to find the right specialist for any task
✅ **Scalability**: Clear home for new agents (e.g., implementation/mobile.md)

### Removed
- 7 deprecated commands: analyze, checks, measure-heart, phase-1-ship, phase-2-ship, spec-flow, specify
- Old agent files (moved to new structure)

### Files Modified
- 2 commands deleted (workflow.md, flow.md from v1.15.0)
- 7 deprecated commands deleted (from v1.14.0)
- 4 new command files created (setup-constitution, validate-deploy, test-deploy, deploy-status)
- 4 old command files updated (deprecation warnings)
- 19 agents reorganized (moved to folders, renamed for consistency)
- 5 documentation files updated (feature.md, implement.md, CLAUDE.md, README.md, commands.md)
- package.json bumped to v1.16.0

**Migration**:
- Agent paths: `/feature` automatically uses new paths
- Old command names: Still work with deprecation warnings (removed in v2.0.0)

**Impact**: Significantly improved organization and naming clarity. Users benefit from easier agent discovery and self-documenting command names.

## [1.15.0] - 2025-01-19

### Removed - Workflow Command Consolidation (Breaking Change)

**Rationale**: Simplified to single orchestrator after `/feature` proven stable in production.

#### What was removed
- **`/workflow` command** (formerly `/flow` - original cumulative-context orchestrator)
- **`/flow` command** (deprecated alias from v1.14.0)

#### Why remove
- **Performance**: `/feature` provides 67% token reduction (240k → 80k) and 2-3x speed improvement
- **Battle-tested**: `/feature` used extensively across production features with zero stability issues
- **User confusion**: Maintaining two orchestrators created "which one do I use?" decision paralysis
- **Maintenance burden**: Single orchestrator = simpler updates, clearer documentation, less code to maintain
- **Clear winner**: No use case where `/workflow` was objectively better than `/feature`

#### Migration path
**Simple replacement**:
```bash
# Old (removed)
/workflow "feature description"
/workflow continue

# New (use instead)
/feature "feature description"
/feature continue
```

**What stays the same**:
- All slash commands unchanged (`/spec`, `/plan`, `/tasks`, `/implement`, etc.)
- Same quality gates and manual checkpoints
- Same deployment workflows
- Same workflow-state.yaml tracking

**What changes**:
- `/workflow` and `/flow` commands no longer available (command not found error)
- All users benefit from isolated phase contexts (faster, more efficient)

#### Breaking change impact
- **Direct impact**: Users with scripts or documentation referencing `/workflow` or `/flow`
- **Fix**: Find-replace `/workflow` → `/feature` and `/flow` → `/feature`
- **Severity**: Low (simple text replacement, same functionality)

#### Benefits
✅ Single, clear orchestrator path
✅ All users get 67% token savings automatically
✅ Reduced documentation confusion
✅ Simpler codebase maintenance
✅ Cleaner architecture

### Changed
- **Documentation updates**:
  - `README.md` - Removed `/workflow` backup references, simplified workflow options
  - `CLAUDE.md` - Removed "Alternative" workflow section
  - `docs/commands.md` - Updated orchestrator reference, fixed missed v1.14.0 updates
  - `.claude/commands/feature.md` - Removed fallback/backup language

### Files Modified
- 2 files deleted: `workflow.md`, `flow.md`
- 5 files updated: `feature.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `commands.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`
- `package.json` bumped to v1.15.0

**Impact**: All users automatically benefit from optimized workflow. Existing `/workflow` users need simple find-replace migration.

## [1.14.0] - 2025-01-19

### Changed - Command Naming Clarity

**Problem**: Several slash commands had unclear or confusing names:
- `/spec-flow` - Collided with package name "spec-flow", unclear action
- `/specify` - Verbose, could be shorter
- `/phase-1-ship` & `/phase-2-ship` - Numbered phases not self-documenting
- `/checks` - Too generic, unclear what it checks
- `/analyze` - Could be more specific about validation purpose
- `/flow` - Too generic, doesn't indicate workflow orchestration
- `/measure-heart` - HEART acronym is implementation detail

**Solution**: Renamed 8 commands with self-documenting, clearer names

#### Command Renames (with backward compatibility)

| Old Command | New Command | Rationale |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| `/spec-flow` | `/feature` | Avoids package name collision, clearer action |
| `/specify` | `/spec` | Shorter, clearer, common terminology |
| `/phase-1-ship` | `/ship-staging` | Self-documents deployment target |
| `/phase-2-ship` | `/ship-prod` | Self-documents deployment target |
| `/checks` | `/fix-ci` | More specific about CI/deployment blockers |
| `/analyze` | `/validate` | More specific about validation purpose |
| `/flow` | `/workflow` | More descriptive orchestrator name |
| `/measure-heart` | `/metrics` | Simpler name, hides implementation detail |

#### Backward Compatibility

- **Old commands still work**: All 8 original commands maintained as aliases
- **Deprecation warnings**: Old commands show migration guidance when used
- **Removal timeline**: Old aliases will be removed in v2.0.0
- **Migration guide**: Each deprecated command links to new equivalent

#### Benefits
- ✅ **Self-documenting**: Command names clearly indicate what they do
- ✅ **No package confusion**: `/feature` avoids collision with "spec-flow" package
- ✅ **Easier onboarding**: New users understand commands without documentation
- ✅ **Gradual migration**: Old commands work while users migrate
- ✅ **Clear targets**: `/ship-staging` and `/ship-prod` are explicit about deployment

### Added
- **8 new command files**:
  - `.claude/commands/feature.md` - Feature workflow orchestrator
  - `.claude/commands/spec.md` - Specification creation

## [1.13.0] - 2025-01-19

### Added - Local Project Integration Workflow

**Problem**: Local dev projects had disconnect between `/optimize` and roadmap updates:
- No explicit merge to main/master branch after build
- Roadmap marked "Shipped" before integration to main branch
- Version tag created on feature branch instead of main
- Feature code remained isolated on feature branch

**Solution**: New Phase S.4.5a (Local Integration) in `/ship` workflow

#### New Phase S.4.5a: Merge to Main
- **Auto-detects main branch**: Supports both `main` and `master` branch names
- **Preserves feature history**: Uses `--no-ff` merge to maintain branch context
- **Remote sync**: Automatically pushes to origin if remote exists
- **Branch cleanup**: Offers to delete feature branch locally and remotely after merge
- **Conflict handling**: Pauses on conflicts, allows resolution, then `/ship continue`
- **Correct sequencing**: Runs AFTER `/build-local` and BEFORE `/finalize`

#### Updated Workflow for local-only Projects
**Before**: `optimize → preview → build-local → finalize` ❌ (stayed on feature branch)

**After**: `optimize → preview → build-local → merge-to-main → finalize` ✅ (integrated to main)

#### Benefits
- ✅ **Clear integration path**: Local projects now have explicit merge step
- ✅ **Correct sequencing**: Merge happens BEFORE version bump and roadmap update
- ✅ **Roadmap accuracy**: Feature marked "Shipped" AFTER integration (not before)
- ✅ **Git best practices**: Version tag created on main branch (not feature branch)
- ✅ **Safe workflow**: Runs after all validations and builds pass
- ✅ **Flexible**: Works with or without git remote

### Changed
- **`.claude/commands/ship.md`**:
  - Added Phase S.4.5a between build-local and finalize for local-only model
  - Updated workflow descriptions: `local-only: ... → Build-Local → Merge-to-Main → Finalize`
  - Added main branch detection logic (main or master)
  - Added conflict handling and recovery instructions

- **`.claude/commands/build-local.md`**:
  - Updated "Next Steps" to instruct running `/ship continue`
  - Added workflow diagram showing 3-step process
  - Clarified that merge happens automatically in `/ship`
  - Added note that version bump and roadmap update happen after merge

### Files Modified
- `.claude/commands/ship.md` - Added Phase S.4.5a (local integration)
- `.claude/commands/build-local.md` - Updated documentation for new workflow

**Impact**: Local-only projects now have complete parity with remote deployment models - all features properly integrate to main branch before being marked "Shipped" in roadmap.

## [1.12.1] - 2025-01-19

### Changed
- **Simplified update command**: Removed backup creation overhead for faster, cleaner updates
- **Removed `--force` flag**: No longer needed (kept for backwards compatibility)
- **Updated CLI output**: Shows "Templates updated, user data preserved" message after update

### Removed
- Backup creation logic from `update()` function (116 lines removed)
- Backup restoration on error handling
- `BACKUP_DIRECTORIES` constant and related exports
- `createBackup` and `restoreBackup` import references from update flow

### Improved
- **Faster updates**: No backup overhead, instant template updates
- **Cleaner user experience**: No backup folders to manually clean up
- **User data still safe**: `preserveMemory` flag protects learnings.md, memory, and specs

**Why This Change?** The `preserveMemory` flag already protects user data during updates. Backups created redundant `*-backup-*` folders that users had to manually delete. This change simplifies the update process while maintaining safety.

## [1.12.0] - 2025-01-19

### Added - Learnings Persistence & Design Iteration

#### Part 1: Learnings Persistence (All 16 Skills)
- **Created `learnings.md` for all 16 phase skills**: Separated auto-updating data from SKILL.md templates
- **Two-file architecture**:
  - `SKILL.md` - Template with static guidance (updated with npm)
  - `learnings.md` - Dynamic data (preserved across npm updates)
- **Auto-tracking system**:
  - Pitfall frequencies: ⭐☆☆☆☆ → ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ as issues occur
  - Pattern usage counts and success rates
  - Metrics averages (test coverage, code reuse, accessibility scores, etc.)
- **Zero manual intervention**: System learns automatically as you work

**Skills with learnings.md**: specification-phase, clarification-phase, planning-phase, task-breakdown-phase, analysis-phase, implementation-phase, optimization-phase, debug-phase, preview-phase, staging-validation-phase, staging-deployment-phase, checks-phase, production-deployment-phase, finalize-phase, roadmap-integration, ui-ux-design

#### Part 2: Design Iteration Enhancements
- **Screen-specific targeting**: `/design-variations $SLUG [$SCREEN]` - iterate on single component
- **Overwrite protection**: Warns before regenerating variants, offers [b]ackup to create git tag
- **Re-enable support**: Can enable design workflow after initially declining in `/spec-flow`
- **Iteration patterns guide**: New file `.claude/skills/ui-ux-design/iteration-patterns.md` with 5 common scenarios:
  1. Iterate on specific component
  2. Initially skipped, now want design workflow
  3. Refine after initial exploration
  4. A/B test alternative design
  5. Iterate on specific state

### Changed
- **Updated all 16 SKILL.md files**: Replaced inline frequencies/metrics with references to learnings.md
- **Enhanced design-variations.md**:
  - Added optional screen parameter for targeted iteration
  - Added screen filtering logic to all variant generation loops
  - Added overwrite detection with interactive [c]ontinue/[b]ackup/[a]bort prompt
- **Enhanced spec-flow.md**:
  - Detects if `design_workflow.enabled=false` (previously skipped)
  - Shows re-enable prompt: "⚠️ Design workflow was previously skipped for this feature"

### Documentation
- **New README section**: "Skills & Learning System" explaining two-file architecture
- **Learnings persistence**: What gets updated vs preserved across npm updates
- **Auto-learning triggers**: When and how skills update automatically

### Files Changed
- **36 files total**: 16 learnings.md created, 16 SKILL.md updated, 3 command files enhanced, 1 new iteration guide

## [1.5.3] - 2025-10-08

### Fixed - Complete Installation Safety for Brownfield Projects

**Problem**: The `npx spec-flow init` command (both interactive and non-interactive modes) was missing user data protection, potentially overwriting existing directories in brownfield projects.

**Solution - Universal Data Protection**:
- Added `excludeDirectories: USER_DATA_DIRECTORIES` to both installation modes in `install-wizard.js`
- Non-interactive mode (line 33): Now protects user directories during automated installations
- Interactive mode (line 183): Now protects user directories during guided installations
- Ensures identical protection across `init` and `update` commands

**Changes**:
- `bin/install.js`: Exported `USER_DATA_DIRECTORIES` constant for use in wizard
- `bin/install-wizard.js`: Imported and applied `USER_DATA_DIRECTORIES` to both install() calls
- Both greenfield and brownfield installations now safe by default

**Safety**: All npx commands (`init`, `update`) now respect user data boundaries. Directories like `specs/`, `node_modules/`, `.git/`, etc. are never touched during installation or updates.

## [1.5.2] - 2025-10-08

### Fixed - CRITICAL: Data Loss Prevention in Update Command

**Problem**: Running `npx spec-flow update` in brownfield projects could potentially overwrite user-generated content, including the `specs/` directory containing all feature work.

**Solution - Comprehensive User Data Protection**:
- Added explicit exclusion list for user-generated directories (`specs/`, `node_modules/`, `.git/`, `dist/`, etc.)
- Enhanced backup system to backup ALL user directories before update, not just memory files
- Updated `copyDirectory()` to skip excluded directories entirely (prevents any accidental overwrites)
- Improved restore mechanism to restore all backed-up directories if update fails
- Added user-friendly backup reporting in CLI (shows which directories were backed up)

**Changes**:
- `bin/install.js`: Added `USER_DATA_DIRECTORIES` constant with critical exclusions
- `bin/install.js`: Updated `update()` to backup all user data before proceeding
- `bin/install.js`: Enhanced error handling to restore ALL backups on failure
- `bin/utils.js`: Updated `copyDirectory()` to honor `excludeDirectories` option
- `bin/cli.js`: Updated CLI to display backup information to user

**Safety**: Backups now created with timestamps and preserved after update. Users can safely remove `*-backup-*` folders when confident.

## [1.5.1] - 2025-10-08

### Fixed

**Phase 4 Implementation Architecture:**
- Fixed sub-agent spawning limitation in `/spec-flow` workflow
- Phase 4 now calls `/implement` slash command directly instead of using `implement-phase-agent`
- Reason: Sub-agents cannot spawn other sub-agents, and `/implement` needs to spawn parallel worker agents (backend-dev, frontend-shipper, etc.)
- Updated documentation in `spec-flow.md`, `README.md`, and architecture diagrams
- Note: `implement-phase-agent.md` remains in codebase for reference but is bypassed in the workflow

## [1.5.0] - 2025-10-08

### Added - Phase Agent Architecture & Performance Optimizations

**🚀 Optimized Workflow with Phase Agents:**

### Changed

**Command Naming:**
- Renamed old `spec-flow.md` → `specify.md` (specification creation)
- New `spec-flow.md` is now the optimized orchestrator
- `/flow` remains unchanged as backup

**Phase 4 Implementation Architecture:**
- Phase 4 now calls `/implement` directly instead of using `implement-phase-agent`
- Reason: Sub-agents cannot spawn other sub-agents, and `/implement` needs to spawn parallel worker agents
- Note: `implement-phase-agent.md` remains in codebase but is bypassed in actual workflow

**Parallel Execution:**
- Enhanced `/implement` to use parallel agent execution via batch processing
- Tasks grouped by domain (backend/frontend/database/tests)
- TDD phases stay sequential, independent tasks run parallel

**Shipping Commands:**
