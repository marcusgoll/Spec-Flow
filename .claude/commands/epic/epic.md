# /epic — Epic-Level Workflow Orchestration

**Purpose**: Transform high-level product goals into coordinated multi-sprint implementations with parallel execution, self-adaptation, and comprehensive walkthrough documentation.

**Command**: `/epic [epic description | slug | continue | next]`

**When to use**: For complex features requiring multiple sprints (>2 sprints), cross-cutting concerns, or when automatic sprint decomposition and parallel execution would accelerate delivery.

**Autopilot**: Executes automatically until completion, only pausing on critical failures.

---

## Mental Model

**Architecture: Epic Orchestrator + Meta-Prompting + Parallel Sprint Execution**

- **Orchestrator** (`/epic`): Manages epic lifecycle, auto-triggers /init-project if needed, coordinates sprint dependencies
- **Meta-Prompting**: Research → Plan → Implement pipeline with isolated sub-agent execution
- **Parallel Sprints**: Dependency graph analysis enables simultaneous sprint execution
- **Adaptive**: Analyzes patterns across epics, generates project-specific tooling

**Benefits**: 3-5x faster delivery, LLM-optimized XML documentation, self-improving workflow, project-aware tooling generation.

<context>
**User Input**: $ARGUMENTS

**Project State**: !`test -d docs/project && echo "initialized" || echo "missing"`

**Git Configuration**:

- Remote: !`git remote -v 2>$null | Select-String -Pattern "origin" -Quiet && echo "configured" || echo "none"`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current 2>$null || echo "none"`
- Staging workflow: !`test -f .github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml && echo "present" || echo "missing"`

**Epic Workspace**: !`dir /b /ad epics 2>$null || echo "none"`

**Workflow State**: @epics/\*/state.yaml
</context>

<objective>
Execute multi-sprint epic workflow for: $ARGUMENTS

Transform high-level product goals into coordinated multi-sprint implementations through:

1. Interactive scoping with question bank (8-9 structured questions)
2. Meta-prompted research and planning (isolated sub-agents)
3. Parallel sprint execution (dependency graph-driven)
4. Adaptive quality gates and deployment (model auto-detection)
5. Comprehensive walkthrough generation and self-improvement

**Deployment model** auto-detected from git configuration:

- staging-prod: Git remote + staging branch + staging workflow
- direct-prod: Git remote without staging infrastructure
- local-only: No git remote configured

**Autopilot behavior**: All phases execute automatically. Only stops for critical blockers: CI failures, security issues, deployment errors.
</objective>

<process>
### Step 0.1: Initialize Epic State

**Parse user input and initialize epic workspace:**

```javascript
const args = "$ARGUMENTS".trim();
const epicDescription = args;
```

**Display autopilot mode:**

```
🤖 Autopilot enabled - executing automatically until completion or error
```

**Create/update state.yaml:**

```yaml
# epics/{EPIC_SLUG}/state.yaml
epic:
  number: { EPIC_NUMBER }
  slug: { EPIC_SLUG }
  title: { EPIC_TITLE }
  started_at: { ISO_TIMESTAMP }
  current_phase: specification

phases:
  specification: pending
  research: pending
  planning: pending
  implementation: pending
  optimization: pending
  deployment: pending
  finalization: pending

sprints:
  total: 0 # Updated after planning
  completed: 0
  failed: 0

layers:
  total: 0 # Updated after planning
  completed: 0
```

**Autopilot behavior**: All phases execute automatically. Only stops for critical blockers: CI failures, security issues, deployment errors.

### Step 0.2: Auto-Initialize Project (If Needed)

**Check for project initialization:**

```bash
test -d docs/project && echo "initialized" || echo "missing"
```

**If missing, auto-trigger project setup:**

1. Use AskUserQuestion tool:

   - **Question**: "No project documentation found. Initialize project now?"
   - **Options**:
     - "Yes, full setup" → Run /init-project + optional /init-brand-tokens
     - "Quick setup" → Run /init-project with minimal questions
     - "Skip" → Continue without project docs (not recommended)

2. If user selects initialization:
   - Run `/init-project` command
   - Detect project type: Check for `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, etc.
   - Ask: "Is this a UI project?" → If yes, run `/init-brand-tokens`
   - Ask: "Use default engineering principles?" → If no, run `/constitution`

**Once project initialized, proceed to epic creation.**

### Step 0.3: Prototype Detection (Non-Blocking)

**Check for project prototype before starting specification:**

```bash
# Check if prototype exists
PROTOTYPE_EXISTS=$(test -f design/prototype/state.yaml && echo "true" || echo "false")
```

**If prototype exists:**

1. Analyze epic description for UI keywords:
   ```javascript
   const uiKeywords = [
     'screen', 'page', 'view', 'dashboard', 'modal', 'dialog',
     'form', 'list', 'table', 'settings', 'profile', 'wizard',
     'UI', 'frontend', 'interface'
   ];
   const description = "$ARGUMENTS".toLowerCase();
   const hasUIIntent = uiKeywords.some(kw => description.includes(kw));
   ```

2. If UI intent detected, compare against prototype screen registry:
   ```bash
   # Read existing screens from prototype
   cat design/prototype/state.yaml
   ```

3. If new screens might be needed for this epic, soft prompt user via AskUserQuestion:
   ```json
   {
     "question": "This epic may require new UI screens. Update prototype first?",
     "header": "Prototype",
     "multiSelect": false,
     "options": [
       {"label": "Yes, update prototype", "description": "Add screens for this epic to prototype now (recommended for cohesive design)"},
       {"label": "Later", "description": "Skip for now, can update prototype during sprint planning"},
       {"label": "Not needed", "description": "This epic doesn't require new screens"}
     ]
   }
   ```

4. **If "Yes"**: Pause and suggest running `/prototype update`
5. **If "Later" or "Not needed"**: Continue to specification phase

**If no prototype exists**: Skip silently (backward compatible)

**Note**: This is a soft prompt, not a blocking gate. Epics can proceed without prototype.

---

### Step 0.4: Prototype Source Detection (Auto-Population)

**Check if epic was created from prototype extraction (`/prototype extract --to-epic`):**

```bash
# Check for prototype source indicator in state.yaml
EPIC_SOURCE=$(yq eval '.source // "manual"' "$EPIC_DIR/state.yaml" 2>/dev/null)
```

**If `source: prototype` detected:**

1. **Load pre-populated epic-spec.md:**
   ```bash
   # Epic spec already populated from prototype discovery
   cat "$EPIC_DIR/epic-spec.md"
   ```

2. **Load discovered features as backlog:**
   ```bash
   # Features extracted from prototype
   cat "$EPIC_DIR/discovered-features.md"
   ```

3. **Load component requirements:**
   ```bash
   # Components identified during extraction
   cat "$EPIC_DIR/component-inventory.md"
   ```

4. **Display prototype source summary:**
   ```
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
     Epic Pre-Populated from Prototype
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

     Source: design/prototype/
     Features Discovered: [N]
     Suggested Sprints: [M]
     Components Required: [K]
     Open Questions: [Q]

     Artifacts Pre-Loaded:
       ✓ epic-spec.md (from discovered features)
       ✓ discovered-features.md
       ✓ component-inventory.md

   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   ```

5. **Skip redundant scoping questions:**
   - Skip "What type of epic is this?" → Already inferred from prototype
   - Skip "What subsystems are involved?" → Already identified from screens
   - Skip "Estimated complexity?" → Already calculated from features

   **Instead, ask only:**
   ```json
   {
     "question": "Review the pre-populated epic spec. Ready to proceed to planning?",
     "header": "Prototype Epic",
     "multiSelect": false,
     "options": [
       {"label": "Yes, proceed to planning", "description": "Spec looks good, start /plan phase"},
       {"label": "Modify spec first", "description": "Edit epic-spec.md before planning"},
       {"label": "Add more features", "description": "Return to prototype to discover more"}
     ]
   }
   ```

6. **If "Yes"**: Skip to Step 2 (Planning Phase)
7. **If "Modify spec"**: Open epic-spec.md for editing, then proceed
8. **If "Add more features"**: Pause and suggest `/prototype explore`

**If `source: manual` or not set**: Proceed with normal Step 1 scoping questions.

---

### Step 1: Create Epic Specification

**Parse user input and detect complexity:**

- If description < 50 words → Likely simple feature, suggest `/feature` instead
- If description mentions multiple subsystems/phases → Epic candidate
- If unclear → Use AskUserQuestion to clarify scope

**Use AskUserQuestion extensively for clarification:**

```javascript
// Example questions (adaptive based on description analysis)
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [
    {
      question: "What type of epic is this?",
      header: "Epic Type",
      multiSelect: false,
      options: [
        { label: "New feature", description: "Brand new functionality" },
        { label: "Enhancement", description: "Improve existing features" },
        {
          label: "Refactoring",
          description: "Improve code without changing behavior",
        },
        {
          label: "Infrastructure",
          description: "Dev tools, CI/CD, monitoring",
        },
      ],
    },
    {
      question: "What subsystems are involved?",
      header: "Subsystems",
      multiSelect: true,
      options: [
        {
          label: "Backend API",
          description: "Server-side logic and endpoints",
        },
        { label: "Frontend UI", description: "User interface components" },
        { label: "Database", description: "Schema changes or data migrations" },
        {
          label: "Infrastructure",
          description: "Deployment, monitoring, CI/CD",
        },
      ],
    },
    {
      question: "What's the complexity level?",
      header: "Complexity",
      multiSelect: false,
      options: [
        {
          label: "Small (2-3 sprints)",
          description: "~1 week, clear requirements",
        },
        {
          label: "Medium (4-6 sprints)",
          description: "2-3 weeks, some unknowns",
        },
        {
          label: "Large (7+ sprints)",
          description: "1+ month, significant research needed",
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

**Generate epic specification (Markdown format):**

```bash
# Step 1: Branch, Worktree, and Epic Workspace Creation
# Uses create-new-epic.sh script which handles:
# - Worktree creation (if worktrees.auto_create is true in user-preferences.yaml)
# - Git branch creation (fallback if worktrees disabled)
# - Epic directory structure (epics/NNN-slug/)
# - Initial files: epic-spec.md, state.yaml, NOTES.md
# - Subdirectories: visuals/, artifacts/, mockups/

# Execute the script with JSON output for parsing
EPIC_RESULT=$(bash .spec-flow/scripts/bash/create-new-epic.sh --json "$EPIC_DESCRIPTION")

# Parse results
EPIC_DIR=$(echo "$EPIC_RESULT" | grep -o '"EPIC_DIR": *"[^"]*"' | sed 's/"EPIC_DIR": *"//' | sed 's/"$//')
BRANCH_NAME=$(echo "$EPIC_RESULT" | grep -o '"BRANCH_NAME": *"[^"]*"' | sed 's/"BRANCH_NAME": *"//' | sed 's/"$//')
WORKTREE_ENABLED=$(echo "$EPIC_RESULT" | grep -o '"WORKTREE_ENABLED": *[^,}]*' | sed 's/"WORKTREE_ENABLED": *//')
WORKTREE_PATH=$(echo "$EPIC_RESULT" | grep -o '"WORKTREE_PATH": *"[^"]*"' | sed 's/"WORKTREE_PATH": *"//' | sed 's/"$//')
SLUG=$(echo "$EPIC_RESULT" | grep -o '"SLUG": *"[^"]*"' | sed 's/"SLUG": *"//' | sed 's/"$//')

echo ""
echo "Epic workspace created:"
echo "   Directory: $EPIC_DIR"
echo "   Branch: $BRANCH_NAME"
echo "   Worktree: $([[ "$WORKTREE_ENABLED" == "true" ]] && echo "Yes ($WORKTREE_PATH)" || echo "No")"
echo ""

# If worktree was created, switch to that directory for subsequent work
if [[ "$WORKTREE_ENABLED" == "true" && -n "$WORKTREE_PATH" ]]; then
    cd "$WORKTREE_PATH"
fi

# Script already created:
# - epic-spec.md (template with placeholders)
# - state.yaml (workflow state tracking)
# - NOTES.md (session notes)
# - visuals/, artifacts/, mockups/ directories

# Now proceed to populate epic-spec.md with structured scoping questions (Step 1.5)
```

**Epic specification structure:**

```

**Alternative (recommended): Use git-workflow-enforcer skill:**

```bash
# Invoke skill to auto-generate commit
/meta:enforce-git-commits --phase "epic-specification"
```

**Auto-proceed**: Specification complete, continuing to scoping questions.

### Step 1.5: Interactive Epic Scoping (Question Bank-Driven)

**Purpose**: Systematically scope the epic with 5 rounds of structured questions (8-9 total), eliminating ambiguity before planning.

**When to invoke**: Always for new epics. Skip if resuming with `/epic continue`.

**Skill reference**: See `.claude/skills/epic-scoping/SKILL.md` for detailed implementation.

**Quick summary**:

1. **Round 1**: Business goal + subsystem selection (2 questions)
2. **Round 2**: Scope refinement per subsystem (0-4 conditional)
3. **Round 3**: Success metrics (2 questions)
4. **Round 4**: Dependencies & constraints (2 questions)
5. **Round 5**: Complexity assessment (2 questions)

**Output**: Fully populated epic-spec.md with zero ambiguities, ready for /plan.

**Velocity benefit**: 5-10 minutes vs 30+ minutes unstructured (3-6x faster)

### Step 2: Auto-Invoke Clarification (If Needed)

**NEW in v5.0**: With interactive scoping (Step 1.5), /clarify should **rarely** be needed for epics.

**Ambiguity check** (after interactive scoping):

- Count placeholders in epic-spec.md: `grep -c "\[NEEDS CLARIFICATION\]" epics/NNN-slug/epic-spec.md`
- Check for missing subsystems
- Verify success metrics defined
- Confirm constraints documented

**If ambiguities detected** (ambiguity score > 30):

```bash
/clarify
```

**The /clarify command will:**

- Use AskUserQuestion for 2-6 targeted questions
- Validate answers against project docs (tech-stack.md, architecture.md)
- Update epic-spec.md with clarifications
- Mark clarification phase complete in state.yaml

**Expected outcome**: With 5-round interactive scoping (Step 1.5), most epics have ambiguity score < 30 and skip /clarify entirely.

**If clear** (score ≤ 30), skip /clarify and proceed to planning.

### Step 3: Meta-Prompting for Research & Planning

**Purpose**: Use isolated sub-agents via `/create-prompt` and `/run-prompt` to generate research and planning artifacts.

**Skill reference**: See `.claude/skills/epic-meta-prompting/SKILL.md` for detailed implementation.

**Process summary**:

1. `/create-prompt "Research technical approach for: [epic objective]"` → generates research prompt
2. `/run-prompt 001-[epic-slug]-research` → executes research, outputs research.md
3. `/create-prompt "Create implementation plan based on research"` → generates plan prompt
4. `/run-prompt 002-[epic-slug]-plan` → executes planning, outputs plan.md
5. Commit both artifacts with `/meta:enforce-git-commits`

**Outputs**: `research.md` (findings, confidence, open questions) and `plan.md` (architecture, phases, risks)

**Auto-proceed**: Research and planning complete, continuing to sprint breakdown.

### Step 4: Sprint Breakdown with Dependency Graph

**Purpose**: Generate sprint-plan.md with dependency graph and execution layers for parallel implementation.

**Skill reference**: See `.claude/skills/epic-sprints/SKILL.md` for detailed implementation.

**Invoke**: `/tasks` (reads plan.md, generates sprint breakdown)

**Process**:

1. Analyze complexity and identify sprint boundaries
2. Build dependency graph between sprints
3. Lock API contracts for parallel work
4. Generate execution layers for parallelization

**Outputs**:

- `sprint-plan.md` - Sprints with dependencies, hours, subsystems, locked contracts
- `tasks.md` - All tasks across sprints with acceptance criteria
- `contracts/api/*.yaml` - Locked API contracts

**Commit**: `/meta:enforce-git-commits --phase "epic-sprint-breakdown"`

### Step 5: Parallel Sprint Implementation

**Invoke /implement-epic for parallel sprint execution:**

```bash
# Read auto_mode from state.yaml
AUTO_MODE=$(yq -r '.epic.auto_mode // "false"' epics/*/state.yaml)

# Pass auto_mode flag to implement-epic
if [ "$AUTO_MODE" = "true" ]; then
    /implement-epic --auto-mode
else
    /implement-epic
fi
```

**The /implement-epic phase will:**

1. Read sprint-plan.md to get execution layers
2. For each layer:
   - Launch parallel Task agents (one per sprint in layer)
   - Each agent reads:
     - epic-spec.md (requirements)
     - research.md (findings)
     - plan.md (architecture)
     - tasks.md (filtered to sprint)
     - Locked API contracts
   - Wait for all agents in layer to complete
   - Validate outputs:
     - Tests passing
     - Types checking
     - Contracts respected
     - No breaking changes
3. Continuous validation during implementation:
   - TDD enforcement (tests first)
   - Type safety (no implicit any)
   - Anti-duplication (reuse existing)
   - Spec compliance (requirements met)
4. Consolidate results after each layer
5. Auto-audit workflow effectiveness

**Progress monitoring:**

```
Layer 1/3: S01 (auth-backend) ✓ Complete
Layer 2/3: S02 (auth-frontend) → In progress (65%)
Layer 3/3: S03 (auth-integration) → Pending
```

**After implementation complete, auto-run workflow audit:**

```bash
/audit-workflow
```

**Outputs:**

- Implementation across `epics/NNN-slug/sprints/S01/`, `S02/`, `S03/`
- Consolidated test results
- audit-report.xml with effectiveness metrics

### Step 6: Optimization & Quality Gates

**Invoke /optimize:**

```bash
/optimize
```

**The /optimize phase will:**

1. Run quality checks across all sprints:
   - Performance benchmarking
   - Accessibility audit (WCAG 2.1 AA)
   - Security scan (dependencies, secrets)
   - Code quality review (KISS, DRY)
   - Integration testing (cross-sprint validation)
2. Run workflow audit (effectiveness metrics)
3. Generate optimization-report.xml

**Quality gates (blocking):**

- All tests passing
- No critical security issues
- Performance benchmarks met
- Accessibility standards met
- No breaking API changes

**If gates fail, workflow pauses. User must fix and run `/epic continue`.**

**Commit optimization results (atomic commit #5):**

```bash
# Extract metadata for commit message
PERF_SCORE=$(yq -r '.performance.score // "N/A"' epics/${EPIC_SLUG}/optimization-report.md)
SEC_SCORE=$(yq -r '.security.score // "N/A"' epics/${EPIC_SLUG}/optimization-report.md)
A11Y_SCORE=$(yq -r '.accessibility.score // "N/A"' epics/${EPIC_SLUG}/optimization-report.md)
QUALITY_SCORE=$(yq -r '.code_quality.score // "N/A"' epics/${EPIC_SLUG}/optimization-report.md)

# Commit optimization results
git add epics/${EPIC_SLUG}/optimization-report.md
git commit -m "docs(epic-optimize): complete optimization for ${EPIC_SLUG}

Performance: ${PERF_SCORE}/100
Security: ${SEC_SCORE}/100
Accessibility: ${A11Y_SCORE}/100
Code quality: ${QUALITY_SCORE}/100

All quality gates passed

Next: /ship

```

**Alternative (recommended): Use git-workflow-enforcer skill:**

```bash
/meta:enforce-git-commits --phase "epic-optimize"
```

### Step 7: Unified Deployment

**Invoke /ship:**

```bash
/ship
```

**The /ship command will:**

1. Auto-detect deployment model from repo:
   - staging-prod: Has staging branch + .github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml
   - direct-prod: Has git remote, no staging
   - local-only: No git remote
2. Execute appropriate deployment workflow
3. Track deployment metadata
4. Create GitHub release (if staging-prod or direct-prod)

**No changes to /ship logic - it already handles all models.**

### Step 8: Walkthrough Generation & Self-Improvement

**Purpose**: Generate comprehensive walkthrough documentation and trigger workflow self-improvement.

**Skill reference**: See `.claude/skills/epic-walkthrough/SKILL.md` for detailed implementation.

**Invoke**: `/finalize`

**Process**:

1. Generate `walkthrough.md` with phases, quality gates, key files, lessons learned
2. Run `/audit-workflow` for post-mortem analysis
3. Pattern detection (after 2-3 epics) for code generation opportunities
4. Run `/heal-workflow` to apply approved improvements
5. Update documentation (CHANGELOG, README, CLAUDE.md)
6. Archive artifacts to `completed/`

**Outputs**:

- `walkthrough.md` - Comprehensive epic summary with velocity metrics
- `workflow-improvements.xml` - Self-improvement suggestions
- Updated project documentation

## Handle Continue Mode

**When resuming with `/epic continue`:**

1. **Detect epic workspace and branch:**

   ```bash
   # Run detection utility to find epic workspace
   WORKFLOW_INFO=$(bash .spec-flow/scripts/utils/detect-workflow-paths.sh 2>/dev/null || pwsh -File .spec-flow/scripts/utils/detect-workflow-paths.ps1 2>/dev/null)

   if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
       WORKFLOW_TYPE=$(echo "$WORKFLOW_INFO" | jq -r '.type')
       BASE_DIR=$(echo "$WORKFLOW_INFO" | jq -r '.base_dir')
       SLUG=$(echo "$WORKFLOW_INFO" | jq -r '.slug')
       CURRENT_BRANCH=$(echo "$WORKFLOW_INFO" | jq -r '.branch')

       # Verify this is an epic workflow
       if [ "$WORKFLOW_TYPE" != "epic" ]; then
           echo "❌ Error: This is a $WORKFLOW_TYPE workflow, not an epic"
           echo "   Use /feature continue for feature workflows"
           exit 1
       fi

       # Check if on correct epic branch
       if [[ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" =~ ^epic/ ]]; then
           echo "✓ Detected epic branch: $CURRENT_BRANCH"
       else
           echo "⚠️  Warning: Not on an epic branch (current: $CURRENT_BRANCH)"
           echo "   Epic workspace detected at: epics/$SLUG"

           # Ask if user wants to switch branches
           AskUserQuestion({
             questions: [{
               question: "Switch to epic branch?",
               header: "Branch Switch",
               multiSelect: false,
               options: [
                 {label: "Yes", description: "Switch to epic/$SLUG branch"},
                 {label: "No", description: "Continue on current branch (not recommended)"}
               ]
             }]
           });

           if (userChoice === "Yes") {
               git checkout -b epic/$SLUG 2>/dev/null || git checkout epic/$SLUG
               echo "✓ Switched to epic/$SLUG"
           }
       fi
   else
       echo "❌ Error: Could not detect epic workspace"
       echo "   Run from project root with an active epic in epics/"
       exit 1
   fi
   ```

2. **Read workflow state:**

   - Read `epics/$SLUG/state.yaml` to find current phase
   - Find first phase with status `in_progress` or `failed`
   - Resume from that phase
   - If manual gate was pending, proceed past it

3. **Check for iteration mode** (v3.0 - Feedback Loop Support):

   ```bash
   # Read iteration state
   CURRENT_ITERATION=$(yq eval '.iteration.current' "epics/$SLUG/state.yaml" 2>/dev/null || echo "1")

   if [ "$CURRENT_ITERATION" -gt 1 ]; then
       echo "🔄 Resuming Iteration $CURRENT_ITERATION"
       echo "   Gaps discovered during validation"
       echo "   Executing supplemental tasks only"
       echo ""

       # Show gap summary
       if [ -f "epics/$SLUG/gaps.md" ]; then
           IN_SCOPE_COUNT=$(yq eval '.gaps.in_scope_count' "epics/$SLUG/state.yaml" 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
           echo "   In-scope gaps: $IN_SCOPE_COUNT"
           echo "   Tasks generated: Check tasks.md (Iteration $CURRENT_ITERATION section)"
           echo ""
       fi

       # Resume from current phase in iteration workflow
       # Typically this will be "implement" phase after gap capture
       CURRENT_PHASE=$(yq eval '.phase' "epics/$SLUG/state.yaml" 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")
       echo "   Resuming from: /$CURRENT_PHASE phase"
   fi
   ```

   **Iteration workflow resume logic:**

   - If iteration > 1 and phase = "implement": Execute supplemental tasks only
   - If iteration > 1 and phase = "optimize": Run iteration-specific quality gates
   - If iteration > 1 and phase = "ship-staging": Deploy iteration N to staging
   - After successful deployment: Loop back to validate-staging for convergence check

## Error Handling

**If any phase fails:**

- Read error details from state.yaml
- Check relevant log files in epics/NNN-slug/
- Present clear error message with file paths
- Suggest fixes based on error type
- Tell user to fix and run `/epic continue`

**Common failure modes:**

- Epic ambiguity → auto-runs `/clarify`
- Planning failures → check plan.md for missing context
- Sprint dependency violations → check sprint-plan.md
- Implementation errors → check per-sprint error logs
- Quality gate failures → check optimization-report.xml
- Deployment failures → check deployment logs

</process>

<success_criteria>
**Epic successfully completed when:**

1. **All artifacts generated**:

   - epic-spec.md (fully populated, zero placeholders)
   - research.md (findings with confidence levels)
   - plan.md (architecture decisions and phases)
   - sprint-plan.md (dependency graph and execution layers)
   - walkthrough.md (comprehensive post-mortem)

2. **Quality gates passed**:

   - All tests passing (>95% coverage)
   - No critical security issues
   - Performance benchmarks met
   - Accessibility WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
   - No breaking API changes

3. **Deployment successful**:

   - Code deployed to target environment (staging/prod/local)
   - Deployment metadata recorded in state.yaml
   - GitHub release created (if applicable)

4. **Self-improvement completed**:

   - Workflow audit executed (/audit-workflow)
   - Patterns analyzed and documented
   - Workflow improvements identified
   - Project documentation updated

5. **State correctly recorded**:
   - state.yaml marks epic as completed
   - All phase statuses show `completed`
   - No blocking failures or errors in state file
</success_criteria>

<verification>
**Before marking epic complete, verify:**

1. **Read state.yaml**: Confirm all phases show `status: completed`
2. **Check artifact existence**:
   ```powershell
   Test-Path epics/NNN-slug/epic-spec.md
   Test-Path epics/NNN-slug/research.md
   Test-Path epics/NNN-slug/plan.md
   Test-Path epics/NNN-slug/sprint-plan.md
   Test-Path epics/NNN-slug/walkthrough.md
   ```
3. **Validate quality gates**: Read optimization-report.xml, confirm no blocking issues
4. **Confirm deployment**: Check deployment-metadata.json for successful deployment timestamp
5. **Verify git state**: Run `git log -1` to confirm final commit exists
6. **Check audit completion**: Verify audit-report.xml exists with effectiveness metrics

**Never claim completion without quoting these verification results.**

## Workflow Tracking

All steps read/write `epics/<NNN-slug>/state.yaml`.

**Todo list example:**

```javascript
TodoWrite({
  todos: [
    {
      content: "Initialize epic state",
      status: "completed",
      activeForm: "Initialized",
    },
    {
      content: "Phase 0: Epic specification",
      status: "completed",
      activeForm: "Created epic-spec.md",
    },
    {
      content: "Phase 0.5: Clarification (if needed)",
      status: "completed",
      activeForm: "Resolved ambiguities",
    },
    {
      content: "Phase 1: Research",
      status: "completed",
      activeForm: "Research complete",
    },
    {
      content: "Phase 1: Planning",
      status: "completed",
      activeForm: "Plan complete",
    },
    {
      content: "Phase 2: Sprint breakdown",
      status: "completed",
      activeForm: "Sprint plan generated",
    },
    {
      content: "Phase 3: Implementation Layer 1",
      status: "completed",
      activeForm: "S01 complete",
    },
    {
      content: "Phase 3: Implementation Layer 2",
      status: "in_progress",
      activeForm: "S02 implementing",
    },
    {
      content: "Phase 3: Implementation Layer 3",
      status: "pending",
      activeForm: "S03 pending",
    },
    {
      content: "Phase 4: Optimization",
      status: "pending",
      activeForm: "Running quality gates",
    },
    {
      content: "Phase 5: Deployment",
      status: "pending",
      activeForm: "Deploying",
    },
    {
      content: "Phase 6: Finalization",
      status: "pending",
      activeForm: "Finalizing epic",
    },
  ],
});
```

**Rules**:

- Exactly one phase is `in_progress` at a time
- All phases execute automatically (true autopilot)
- Only blocks on critical failures: CI failures, security issues, quality gate failures, deployment errors
- Deployment phases adapt to model: `staging-prod`, `direct-prod`, or `local-only`

---

## Anti-Hallucination Rules

1. **Never claim phase completion without quoting `state.yaml`**
   Always `Read` the file and print the actual recorded status.

2. **Cite agent outputs**
   When a phase finishes, paste the returned `{status, summary, stats}` keys.

3. **Do not skip phases unless state marks them disabled**
   Follow the recorded sequence; if required, run it.

4. **Detect the deployment model from the repo**
   Show evidence: `git branch -a`, presence of staging workflow files.

5. **No fabricated summaries**
   If an agent errors, show the error; don't invent success.

6. **Always use AskUserQuestion for clarification**
   Never assume answers - ask user explicitly with options.

## Usage Examples

**Start new epic:**

```bash
/epic "User authentication with OAuth 2.1"
```

**Resume interrupted epic:**

```bash
/epic continue
```

**Start next priority epic from backlog:**

```bash
/epic next
```

---

## Philosophy

**Epics orchestrate multiple sprints**
Unlike `/feature` (single sprint), `/epic` coordinates 2+ sprints with dependencies.

**True autopilot execution**
All phases execute automatically without manual intervention. Only blocks on critical failures.

**State truth lives in `state.yaml`**
Never guess; always read, quote, and update atomically.

**Meta-prompting for research & planning**
Isolated sub-agents with XML outputs prevent context pollution.

**Parallel sprint execution**
Dependency graph enables 3-5x velocity improvement.

**Self-improving workflow**
Audits after each epic, generates project-specific tooling.

**Comprehensive walkthrough**
walkthrough.md captures what worked, what struggled, lessons learned.
