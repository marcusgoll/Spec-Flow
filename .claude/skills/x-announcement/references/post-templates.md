# X Post Templates and Generation Guidelines

## Post Format Requirements

### Character Limits
- **Maximum**: 280 characters (enforced by X API)
- **Target**: 250-270 characters (leaves room for user edits)
- **Minimum**: 100 characters (avoid too brief announcements)

### Structure Pattern
```
{emoji-hook} {Product} v{version} {announcement-verb}!

{emoji} {feature-1}
{emoji} {feature-2}
{emoji} {feature-3}

{benefit-statement}
```

## Emoji Usage Guidelines

### Hook Emojis (Start of Post)
- 🚀 — Major features, launches
- 📦 — Package updates, releases
- ✨ — New features, enhancements
- 🎉 — Celebrations, milestones
- 🔥 — Performance improvements
- 🛡️ — Security fixes
- 🐛 — Bug fixes

### Feature Emojis (Bullet Points)
- ✅ — Completion, success features
- 🔄 — Automation, workflows
- 🧹 — Cleanup, refactoring
- 🎨 — UI/UX improvements
- ⚡ — Performance enhancements
- 🔒 — Security features
- 📊 — Analytics, metrics
- 🔗 — Integrations
- 🌐 — i18n, accessibility

## Content Extraction Algorithm

### 1. Read CHANGELOG Section
```bash
# Extract version section from CHANGELOG
SECTION=$(sed -n "/## \[${NEW_VERSION}\]/,/## \[/p" CHANGELOG.md | head -n -1)
```

### 2. Prioritize Changes by Type
1. **Added** (new features) — Most engaging
2. **Fixed** (bug fixes) — User pain points resolved
3. **Changed** (improvements) — Enhancements to existing
4. **Security** (vulnerabilities) — Critical updates
5. **Deprecated** (removals) — Awareness
6. **Performance** (speed) — Tangible benefits

### 3. Extract Top Features
```bash
# Get Added features (limit 3)
ADDED=$(echo "$SECTION" | grep -A 10 "### Added" | grep "^-" | head -3)

# If <3 Added, supplement with Fixed
if [ $(echo "$ADDED" | wc -l) -lt 3 ]; then
  FIXED=$(echo "$SECTION" | grep -A 10 "### Fixed" | grep "^-" | head -2)
fi
```

### 4. Format with Emojis
```bash
# Map feature keywords to emojis
case "$FEATURE" in
  *automation*|*auto*|*automatic*) EMOJI="🔄" ;;
  *cleanup*|*clean*|*remove*) EMOJI="🧹" ;;
  *performance*|*faster*|*speed*) EMOJI="⚡" ;;
  *security*|*secure*|*vulnerability*) EMOJI="🔒" ;;
  *ui*|*ux*|*design*) EMOJI="🎨" ;;
  *) EMOJI="✨" ;;
esac
```

### 5. Generate Benefit Statement
**Templates:**
- "Ship features faster with less manual work."
- "Build features in half the time."
- "More reliable, secure, and faster workflows."
- "Update immediately to stay secure."
- "Simplify your workflow with one command."
- "Deploy with confidence, every time."

**Selection logic:**
- Security release → "Update immediately to stay secure."
- Performance release → "Build features in half the time."
- Automation features → "Ship features faster..."
- Bug fixes → "More reliable, secure, and faster workflows."

## Validation Checklist

Before posting, validate:
- [ ] Character count ≤280
- [ ] Version number matches `NEW_VERSION` variable
- [ ] At least 2 features highlighted
- [ ] Starts with emoji hook
- [ ] Ends with benefit statement or call-to-action
- [ ] No broken formatting (line breaks preserved)
- [ ] Engaging tone (not just bullet points)

---

## Tone Guidelines

### DO
- Use active voice: "Ship features faster"
- Emphasize benefits: "less manual work"
- Keep concise: 1-2 words per feature
- Show impact: "80% faster", "3x improvement"
- End with action: "Try it now", "Update today"

### DON'T
- Passive voice: "Features can be shipped"
- Technical jargon: "AST-based context compaction"
- Verbose descriptions: Full sentences per feature
- Vague claims: "Better performance"
- End abruptly: No closing statement

---

## Edge Cases

### Too Many Features (>5 in CHANGELOG)
**Solution**: Pick top 3 by impact
- Prioritize user-facing over internal
- Breaking changes > new features > fixes
- Group related features

### Too Few Features (<2 in CHANGELOG)
**Solution**: Supplement with context
```
🚀 Spec-Flow v2.3.0 is here!

✨ Enhanced task breakdown with dependency graphs

More precise task ordering for complex features.
```

### Breaking Changes
**Solution**: Highlight prominently
```
⚠️ Spec-Flow v3.0.0 — Breaking changes!

🔄 New workflow state format (auto-migrated)
📦 Updated slash command syntax
🔗 Migration guide included

Upgrade guide: https://...
```

### Patch Release (Minor Fixes Only)
**Solution**: Focus on reliability
```
🐛 Spec-Flow v2.2.1 patch release

✅ Fixed task status sync edge case
🔧 Improved error messages for failed deployments

Small fixes, big stability gains.
```

---

## Character Optimization Strategies

### 1. Abbreviate Common Terms
- "v" instead of "version"
- "w/" instead of "with"
- "3x" instead of "three times"
- "auto-" instead of "automatic"

### 2. Remove Filler Words
- ❌ "We are excited to announce"
- ✅ "Spec-Flow v2.7.0 is here!"

### 3. Compress Feature Descriptions
- ❌ "Automatically close GitHub issues when features are deployed"
- ✅ "Auto-close GitHub issues when features ship"

### 4. Use Symbols
- "→" for transformation/result
- "+" for additions
- "↑" for improvements
- "↓" for reductions

## Multi-Language Support (Future)

If targeting non-English audiences, maintain format:
```
🚀 Spec-Flow v2.7.0 est disponible!

✨ Releases en une commande avec validation CI
🔄 Fermeture auto des issues GitHub
🧹 Nettoyage essentiel pour tous les modèles

Livrez des fonctionnalités plus rapidement.
```

**Note**: Current implementation English-only, validate character limits work for other languages (emoji count universally)
